      "Did research on cpu's and founf out that this one is more than enough for heavy multitasking and gaming, I would highly recommend this to any first time builder!\n",
      "This is a great CPU with exceptional value! I paid with a z690 mother board and ddr4 ram to upgrade from AMD r7 3700x and was a huge improvement! My temperatures hVe came down also.\n",

      "A year and i ben working amazing i will recommend to everyone.\n",
      "So I was nervous about getting an i5. I don’t know why…but I was. I’ve had an i7 4790k for almost 8 years, and it has been a powerhouse. I love it. Anyway, I tried to do a more budget conscious build, and decided on the 12600k instead of the 12900k. Boy, was I shocked. This sucker is like lightning compared to the 4790k, and it supports all the shiny new doodads on my motherboard. My nvme is screaming, and my 3060 Ti is actually getting warm now that it can reach its potential. I’m seriously impressed. I haven’t overclocked it yet, but it’s coming. I paired it with a Noctua DH15s. I really didn’t want it, but it’s all that was in stock when I needed a cooling tower. The 12600k stays in upper teens, low 20’s at idle, and hasn’t exceeded 54c under load. This is a great processor that I would not hesitate to recommend or buy again!\n",
      "Great product and to be honest knew it would be excellent from the start\n",
      "For the performance you get out of it I feel like it might be one of the best price to performance cpus you could get without go to the used market\n",
      "Super fast. Been using Ryzen for years but not anymore.. also no pins to worry as out bending or break. Great for DIY builders\n",
      "So glad I got this. Heard that it’s one the best cpus known for gaming.\n",
      "Very reliable CPU Intel i5 12600k, use for work, gaming (has built in graphics), mining and more. 4.7 GHz speed with Intel Tuner.\n",
      "Upgraded my chip and RAM after my GPU upgrade. Running swell.\n",

      "Amazing pickup while on sale. Coming from a 6th gen CPU, this thing is like a spaceship. Handles all my games very very easily (Battlefield, Call of Duty, CSGO, etc.). Would definitely recommend this when building a PC. Can't see this thing being topped anytime soon for its price. Power consumption is a tad high but just pair it with a good GPU and you'll never know the difference.\n",
      "Awesome price, awesome performance. Hard to beat for a budget gaming setup. Paired with a 3070TI this thing does an amazing Job and staying cool and helping push anything you can throw at it!\n",
      "I recently purchased the 12600K and a Z690 Tomahawk motherboard as an upgrade in my i5-6400 file/media server/Plex box. Overall, I've been really happy with the upgrade. The increase in raw performance and speed is crazy. Compatibility is top-notch (DDR4, DDR5, PCIE5/4/3, etc). My only complaint is that it's a much more power-hungry chip. My previous setup would idle (and stay at idle) using about 35watts. This setup idles at about 45w, but never stays there--it's constantly bouncing from 45 to 90 or more. So, based on a full-days power usage, I figure that it's consuming 60ish watts doing the same tasks. \n",
      "I should note that I have yet to really dig into the advanced power settings. I was hoping Windows 11 and Intel would provide the best case scenario after some time of learning the PC's behavior. Hasn't happened yet.\n",
      "And I also realize that I my usage might've been better served with a non-K processor; however, I ended up purchasing this guy for less than I would have paid for a 12400. For the increased performance and less cost, I opted for the 12600k.\n",
      "Still not mad that I made that choice!\n",
      "A very good CPU for most things. I bought this for my wife's build almost a year ago. She games with it and it just about keeps up with my 12900k There is very little different on most games. Really good CPU for the price and it does everything you need it to do without bogging down.\n",
      "got a great price on it and literally the next day after i purchase it, they raise it by about $100!!! i lol'd hard...but great lil processor non-the-less. 770uhd integrated graphics great for home media server transcoding needs, and 10 cores great for performance and creating some VM's...good for low-mid tier..i honestly dont notice a different from this and my other pcs I7 12700k\n",
      "Great for your every say run of the mill game. Went from a 4th gen to a 12 gen almost newest out there. What a step up!\n",
      "Performance is great, and price of this 2 generation old chip makes it \"affordable.\" Very happy with purchase.\n",
      "An excellent budget option, perfect for gaming and productivity. You can pair it with any GPU and you won't be bottleneck at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a software developer and this cpu holds pretty well, you can find a lot of options for MB to pair it with.\n",
      "Works great with new MSI board.  Way faster processor than my last.\n",
      "Works great! I do a mixture of light and heavy gaming and this CPU (along with other components) get the job done.\n",
      "Outstanding performance for a midfield Processor. Handles everything I built the system for with plenty of life. Low heat range with plenty of room for upgrading. Hopefully I’ll get another 8 years out of this chip like I did my last Intel i7-4790k.\n",
      "So far this processor has been great! I’m building a gaming pc and I’m getting my gpu tomorrow. But in the mean time, just running off of this processor, it’s the fastest computer I’ve ever had. Still learning more about computers and their parts, but I can run all games not super graphically intensive. Rocket league gets me about 90 fps on low settings, about 60fps on phasmophobia at low settings, 90fps on Minecraft, etc. all without a gpu!\n",
      "I love the 12th gen i5 perfect for gaming! Stays pretty cool!\n",
      "Solid cpu. Its stable. Its not super hot and its a powerful cpu. Cant really complain honestly. I have a 14900k thats delidded and i got this as a backup cpu while im changing the liquid metal on my 14900k lol. Kind of a flex but i hate not being able to use my PC while the glue is drying  or while im changing the liquid metal\n",
      "Great deal on this Intel - Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700, comparing to other cpu's for gaming its a great choice.\n",
      "Was debating between a 13600k and this 12600k. The price difference between the cpus and the minimal benchmark performance in gaming, i went with this bad boy and was not disappointed. Very solid CPU and does not get above 60 degrees celsius with my 212 evo. Should be good for a while before purchasing another!\n",
      "Bought this awhile ago and it still works great ,upgraded from a 9900k and it's so much faster then that\n",
      "I'm running this thing in an H510 Flow case, MSI Z690A Pro Wifi DDR4, 3600 CL16 Trident Z, Noctua NH-U12A cooler.\n",

      "7,200 CB R20 with a basic 4.9 turbo ratio overclock, incredible. With the U12A at full speed it gets into the low 80's during overclocked benchmarks. It will still do a 6,400-6,500 stock pulling 115w instead of the 165w it pull @4.9 all core which drops temps to around 70c or less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaming is more of the same, exceptional single core and great multi core. This thing is more performant than last gen 8 core processors from Intel/AMD, and looks to be the sweet spot if you're doing mainly gaming, even with a higher end card.\n",
      "works great, used in my new pc build. Good value for what im using it for!\n",
      "Although I may not be a genius when it comes to computer parts I know that this CPU is very capable and so far has had no issues running RDR2, 4 Minecraft servers, and windows solitaire at the same time. Unfortunately my cooling system does consist of a window unit and a paper fan powered by me but handles overclocking very well.\n",

      "Great performance out of the box. With a bump here and there this CPU would yield noticeable results.\n",
      "This CPU is one of the most best for gaming. It has plenty of cores to handle gaming and to mutitask. I went with the 12600k over AMD's 5600X because the price was cheaper and this CPU is also faster in single threaded workloads. 6 performance cores plus 4 efficiency cores will be plenty for gaming and moderare workloads for years to come. It also runs fairly cool with a Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 cpu cooler.\n",
      "Great processor for gaming warzone and fortnite!!!\n",
      "Use this cpu to build a custom build under 900 worth the price\n",
      "Not too much to say other than I’m having zero issues with this CPU. I’m playing Fallout 76, Mordhau, CS2, recording music via Reaper and watching movies/listening to music; my cpu is handling everything without issue.\n",
      "I have 12900k and ks’s I overclock on hwbot.org. My 12600k is a beast great bin. Able to stabilize cinebench r23 at 5.4 p core and 4.3 e core memory at 6800 30-39-39-28 1T cmr! R23 score of 21,314 pretty much comparable to a 5900x. That’s a 16 thread cpu vs a 24 thread cpu. The 12600k is that fast for sub $300. In gaming it destroys my 5950x. If you are only gaming get the 12600k it games the same as my 12900ks at 5.5ghz all core.\n",
      "Working great still. I bought this because my old system had finally died so needed to do a full replacement. I bought all of this right before the 13 gen came out and it's working perfectly fine still withthe games I want to play.\n",
      "Great value CPU! I’m very happy with it in my build\n",
      "This is a great cpu for the $$$. Modern, strong and with a decent video card, capable of play I gay aaa modern game\n",
      "For the price if you want an intel build you cant go wrong! Should last all of this gen!\n",
      "Not bad at all!\n",
      "Value is definitely worth it.\n",
      "I'd say buy it while you can.\n",
      "The cpu was very good. It is really good for it’s price and it runs well. Great brand\n",
      "Great cpu! Fast, great bang for the buck. Perfect for gaming.\n",
      "Picked this bad boy up over a Ryzen 5700G or 5800X for one simple reason - my local store had it in stock, as well as a motherboard to pair with it. I upgraded from an i3 10100 on a B400 series board. Paired this with a coolermaster 120mm air cooler and a MSI Z690 board. GPU when comparing the two systems was a RX 6600XT.\n",
      "\n",
      "I let the board do the genie OC thing, it bumped the clock up to 4.8ghz across all 6 P-cores and 3.8ghz on all E-Cores. I managed to get it up to 4.9ghz across all P-Cores and 4ghz across the E-Cores. However, this resulted in unacceptable load temperatures, so I dropped the overclock to 4.7ghz and 3.8ghz with a 140mv undervolt. Runs cool, quiet and fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't done much in the way of CPU specific benchmarking, but I can say there was a notable improvement in gaming, both flatscreen and VR, particularly in poorly optimized games like ARK.\n",
      "\n",
      "The E-Cores are quite fast in their own right - I have used them for gaming as a test, and they aren't dissimilar to the cores on the i3 if you turn off hyper threading. I regularly assign my ARK server to run on them in the background. They also offer amazing power savings - under a typical load of running the server with a browser with multiple tabs open and steam running in the background, the CPU averages only about 12W TDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't encountered any issues with the Windows task scheduler under Windows 10. Performance seems great, and I'm fairly certain my 3070 will be a bottleneck before this CPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "The onboard GPU is a bonus. A fail-safe in case your GPU ever dies. If you want something with a decent iGPU, get a Ryzen 5700G or wait for the next generation with RDNA2 cores.\n",
      "\n",
      "In previous generations, the only reason to get a K series chip was the overclocking abilities. This time around, the E-Cores actually offer a surprising appeal if you need the extra threads, and may actually result in net power savings if you don't run your CPU under load all that often. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't see yourself doing a lot of background stuff, or highly threaded tasks, you would probably be perfectly happy with a 12400 and putting the extra money into a GPU or nvme storage or something. You can get pretty similar gaming performance for a lot less money due to the high price of the Z series boards.\n",
      "I bought this cpu for my gaming pc and it has handled every game I have played with ease. It is a very capable cpu.\n",
      "Works as intended haven’t had any issues and preforms really well under load.\n",
      "great gaming cpu, if you are in a market to buy a great gaming cpou with awesome single thread then this is it. it boost to 4.9 as long as u have great cooler(i have 5ghz on 240mm aio). great for older games like arma which hammers the single core and ofcourse it great for new games since it has 10 core. 6p core and 4e cores. cpu runs cool( mine runs low 70s while gaming on my itx formd t1 with 1 12mm slim fan and 1 25mm fan). pair this cpu with ddr4 mobo and ur good since ddr5 mobo are expensive and useless as of now.\n",
      "Works extremely good and have never experienced and issue as this was my first pc build.\n",
      "Excellent chip, recommended for anyone building a gaming rig\n",
      "As always Intel rocks. Gor it on sale at great price. more power than is needed but for same price as I3. Win-Win.\n",
