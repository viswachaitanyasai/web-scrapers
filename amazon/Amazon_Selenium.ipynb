were used correctly and for example in the second pcie slot the video card was recognized but it only financed by gen x you will understand however that using a video card from maybe  to a quarter of its potential is unacceptable\\n\\nexcellent amazon as always in making the return unfortunate sometimes it happens', 'finally an i that gives a sense to intels midrange first dominated by amd with excellent performance at an honest price\\n\\nthis processor i used it in conjunction with the new unfortunately expensive ram ddr and windows  intel recommends not to use windows  but rather windows  to make the most of the new architecture of the twelfth gen and i found myself really good in all areas\\n photo processing photoshop and lightroom\\n gaming\\n programming c\\n\\nthanks to the new architecture intel has managed to show its muscles again on the single core achieving excellent scores thanks to a significantly improved ipc compared to the old i on many tasks and operations in photoshop i really noticed how the waiting times have halved thanks to the really pushed frequencies\\n\\nmulticore also behaves really well by exporting with lightroom from raw to jpg many photos the pc remains fluid and performing without jerking any other activity or process in progress also on lightroom i was able to appreciate the great efficiency in single core overtake when i apply a preset to numerous photos\\n\\nconsumption is not at the levels of amd but surely this generation has made a big leap forward with regard to the consumption  performance ratio because it is true that it consumes more than a ryzen  x but it is also true that it is more performing than the latter in almost all tests in some very much in others a little\\n\\ni tried some overclocking configurations and i must say that it is easy to set really high frequencies on the p cores highperformance cores increasing the performance however i do not recommend to have the voltage to manage the parent card because unfortunately at  or  ghz it offered me values unnecessarily high and not suitable for the longevity of the cpu itself\\n\\nin conclusion i found myself really well i came from k and the leap leap is felt in every area where i use the pc the price trend will be the real needle of the scale to decree this cpu as a best buy of the midrange because the performance is there the technology as well and finally even the consumption seems to be improved\\n\\ni hope this review was useful', 'we are so so with the results we are getting from this processor my son built a gaming pc for his
