intel-i7-14700k,5,April/2024,amazon,to the next generation
intel-i7-14700k,5,February/2024,amazon,"It arrived in a paper bag. Even though it's a fairly expensive piece of precision equipment, the sloppy packaging is really disappointing. I really don't recommend buying these precision instruments from Amazon. Even when I bought MB, it was a huge paper bag. Even when I bought memory, it was in a paper bag. Of course M.2 too. I bought it on Amazon because it was easy, but I think I need to change my mind. If you have no choice but to purchase from Amazon, choose products sold directly by the manufacturer or shipped directly from the store. The review is on 14geni7, which is the only one that has improved in performance from 13gen.I use it with 4070ti and it is comfortable for both work and gaming. I bought it after hearing that 14gen was the last i series. Since I'm going to install a GPU anyway, I made it with F. I bought it for about 10,000 yen cheaper on sale, and it's even cheaper than K, so it's definitely a good deal. There's nothing better than being cheap, so we strongly recommend that you allocate that much of your budget to the GPU. It's helpful to have a graphics function when your GPU goes bad, but in my case, when my GPU went bad in the first place, there was a limit to what I could do with just the CPU, so I ended up having to use my PC until I bought a new GPU. I didn't use it. Taking advantage of that experience, I have now purchased a spare mid-spec GPU. The problem with the F option is that without a GPU, you won't even have a screen, let alone a BIOS, so if you're making a new one or trying to make one for the first time, you'll have to consider the order in which you buy them, otherwise you won't be able to check the operation, so be careful about that. Let's add . I'm satisfied with the product, but the shipping method was bad, so I gave it a 3."

intel-i9-14900k,5,May/2024,amazon,Processing is fast.
intel-i9-14900k,5,April/2024,amazon,"The performance is great, but the heat generation is also top class. I run it with full-fledged water cooling (30cm radiators*3), but if it is left unrestricted, I hit the thermal throttling every now and then. With the rating, it won't go 80 degrees at most, but if it's unlimited, you can stabilize it by tweaking the voltage VF curve a little. Currently, the maximum temperature is 89 degrees Celsius, which is easier to handle. However, considering the electricity bill, I honestly don't think it's a good value in terms of cost performance. The speed of encoding etc. has increased enough, but the electricity bill is... I am very satisfied with the performance."
intel-i9-14900k,5,February/2024,amazon,"The 13600k is a very good CPU, but the 14600k is just as good. However, even if there is one generation difference, there is no difference in performance. But it's a good CPU, so I give it 5 stars."
intel-i9-14900k,5,January/2024,amazon,"It's genuine and genuine. Strong, fast and safe. I can use it without any problems. The i9 also has a nice silver disc-shaped package. It is made to stand up and display using the packaging material inside the box. Regarding the grease, it was not included in the blue package of the i9 mentioned above, but was included in a separate simple package."
intel-i9-14900k,5,January/2024,amazon,"I was using 128GB on my 13900K, but the 14900K supports up to 192GB, so I took the plunge and bought it. The performance difference isn't that big, but when you overclock and use it, you'll notice how comfortable it is. As an Intel fan, this is a great product for me."
intel-i9-14900k,5,February/2024,amazon,"I have been mainly using AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X for the past few years, but since I want single thread speed, I first went to 13900K and now I have changed to this. The 3990X is used as a calculation PC. I would easily crack it, but it generates even more heat than the 13900K, so I think it would be a difficult CPU for those who use it without adjusting the settings. Also, the power consumption is unnecessarily high, so it may be difficult for people who are concerned about electricity bills. If you don't worry about that, it's a smooth and comfortable CPU."
intel-i9-14900k,5,December/2023,amazon,"Compared to AMD, the stability when using multiple heavy software is excellent.So far, I have not had any problems with games or software. Even with simple water cooling of 240mm, the maximum temperature is 96℃, so it's a shame that it generates a lot of heat."
intel-i9-14900k,5,January/2024,amazon,"simply! I am satisfied with the performance and stability. If you are considering an i9 model with K, the same 13th generation model may be better value for money as there is not that much of a difference in performance even on the bench. Even with OC, I can't feel any difference in performance from the 13th generation..."
intel-i9-14900k,5,March/2024,amazon,"I couldn't stand it until the next generation, so I bought it. Well, it's extremely hot. I used it with a 420mm simple water cooling system, but in my environment it would get stuck at 90 degrees Celsius. I bought a huge case called Corsair's obsidian and installed a 420mm radiator. I'm running two of them, and the good thing about it is that you don't need a heater because it blows out hot air when you place it at your feet."
intel-i9-14900k,5,December/2023,amazon,"Among the new features of the Intel 14th generation, the i5 sadly only has WiFi7 support, but its actual performance seems to be the same as 13600k. However, perhaps because it is a carefully selected stone for the i5, it seems to have a certain degree of OC resistance, and the one I bought can operate stably at 6GHz. The cooler is ROG Ryujin III 240RGB, but even with all P cores at 6GHz, it can be cooled at a maximum of 98 degrees Celsius during Cinebench R23, and the game performance where single core performance is important is quite high. I wonder if this appeal will be conveyed if you consider that it is 14900k that can be cooled except for the cash. The price is a little high, but if you have a Z790 motherboard, you can probably get the most balanced CPU for gaming in the 14th generation, when the 14700k became extremely hot."

The noticeable increase in performance that I experienced is considerable and shows the progress of the technology. The combination with the Asus Apex Encore and the fast MHz RAM delivers great results. After all, I was able to achieve points in Cinebench R without overclocking. The combination offers one Solid foundation for demanding tasks and gaming. However, you should note that the exact performance can vary depending on the application.

intel-i3-13100,5,April/2024,amazon,"Honestly, I don't think I needed this much performance. Modern CPUs are so high-performance."
intel-i3-13100,5,April/2024,amazon,It's working stably.
intel-i3-13100,5,March/2024,amazon,"Since switching from Ryzen to Intel, things have become smoother. Recommended CPU for beginners"
intel-i3-13100,5,January/2024,amazon,"When my i9 10th generation broke down, I had no choice but to downgrade, but I was surprised to see comparable numbers."
intel-i3-13100,5,January/2024,amazon,"Until now, the best CPU was a 6-core, 12-thread CPU, but when I took the plunge and bought one, I found that there was a clear difference in performance with a 10-core, 16-thread CPU. I think the challenge from now on will be how to utilize this CPU. I don't play games much."
intel-i3-13100,5,August/2023,amazon,#VALUE!
intel-i3-13100,5,December/2023,amazon,"Impressions after using it for half a year, no problems. I don't need to go into details because I think people who make their own will understand this. In December 2023, the i7 will be released at a reasonable price. I think I'll probably make my own again after using it for another 5 years."
intel-i3-13100,5,April/2024,amazon,"The product description says 4.50GHz, but this is the maximum frequency when using turbo boost, and the base frequency is 3.4GHz, which is lower than the 3.6GHz of the Core i3 8th generation. When using a computer, I don't know when it is being boosted, but it still runs more smoothly than an 8th generation PC."
intel-i3-13100,5,February/2024,amazon,"Even if you buy an expensive graphics card, the CPU may be a hindrance. For cost performance."
intel-i3-13100,5,December/2023,amazon,"Switched from i5 9600K. Well, there is a gap of 4 generations, so there is no comparison, but without K = 10 cores even without overclocking, it runs at 30% usage even when playing Steam games (even when going to 80% with 9600K) there was). With this performance without overclocking, I think it's a good deal."

intel-i5-13500,5,April/2024,amazon,I feel like you don't need an i7 or i9 unless you're playing a really serious game. This CPU is enough for me.
intel-i5-13500,5,March/2024,amazon,"Switched from 4690K. The cooler uses AK500. It's great because it can maintain around 4GHz even under full load. There are improvements in memory and SSD performance, but it also feels much crisper. Even though it was in the late 30,000 yen range, it was amazing to think that this was middle class. I think it's still a good time to buy, but in the future there will be a trend to incorporate NPU circuits, so if you anticipate that AI-based applications with local processing will become common, it will be several generations before NPUs will be included in desktop applications. If you buy this model, I think you will be able to use it for a long time."
intel-i5-13500,5,April/2024,amazon,"It explained how to install it to the motherboard with illustrations, which was very helpful."
intel-i5-13500,5,January/2024,amazon,"- Changed from Core i7-12700 to Core i5-13500.・I don't feel any physical difference.・Performance is sufficient for business purposes. - Quiet, stable, and cost-effective configuration."
intel-i5-13500,5,January/2024,amazon,"For just under 40,000 yen, the one with 14 cores and 20 threads is a good value."
intel-i5-13500,5,January/2024,amazon,"Core i5-13500 has high performance and great processing power. Adopting 14nm process technology, the clock speed is increased up to 4.80GHz. As a result, you can expect smooth operation even with multitasking and high-load applications. In addition to improved performance, power-saving designs have also evolved to improve energy efficiency. This allows comfortable use in low power states. It can be said to be an excellent choice in terms of cost as it has excellent performance for its price. Suitable for a wide range of uses, including gaming, creative work, and general office use, this product is recommended for users who want to improve their computer's performance."
intel-i5-13500,5,August/2023,amazon,"I was surprised that AviUtl's x265 CPU encoded a 1080p video at 60fps. Comparing with other PCs with the same encoding settings... Core 2 Quad Q8200 is 5fps (as you can imagine since it is the SSE4 era where there is no AVX instruction) Celeon N4100 is 5fps (4 core Atom ≒ Core 2 Quad rule) Ryzen 5 3500U is 7fps (Zen+'s AVX256 internally uses 128-bit processing equivalent to SSE4 and is very slow) Ryzen 5 Pro 3400GE is 17fps (as you can imagine because it's Zen+. It feels about the same as Sandy Bridge) Core i7 4770 is 20fps (faster than Zen+, but it's Haswell, so it feels outdated Undeniable) Ryzne 5 5500U is 25fps (Fake model number Zen2, 6 cores but only outputs 2.5GHz) Core i5 1135G7 is 30fps (AVX512 compatible and fast for 4 cores. As of 2023, Wappa is still the strongest) Ryzen 7 Pro 5750GE captures 45fps (Zen3 does not support AVX512 and is slow for 8 cores) for those who don't know about SSE/AVX. SSE/AVX (so-called SIMD instructions) is a technology that parallelizes calculations by subdividing the CPU's calculation registers (recently 256 to 512 bits) according to variable types (8 to 64 bits). AVX256 calculates 8-bit variables in 32 parallels, but AVX512 can calculate in 64 parallels. The performance of modern CPUs is mostly determined by the speed of AVX instructions. In particular, the speed of video encoding and generation AI clearly shows the superiority of AVX instructions. Since Intel's Haswell Refresh (4th generation), AVX instructions have been fast and are strong in video conversion, and when idle it drops to about 700MHz (at most 1.4GHz with Ryzen), so it's good to have high power saving performance. hey. However, if the motherboard does not have a power limit at all, it will be difficult to cool it down. CPU coolers for TDP65W will drop to around 3.0GHz due to thermal throttling. Still, it's a big deal because it delivers the above performance. If you attach a good CPU cooler, it will probably run at around 4.0GHz all the time. Intel, which makes a wide range of CPUs from Atom to Xeon, is also good at P-Core (single performance specialization) and E-Core (efficiency/multi-performance emphasis) heterogeneous CPUs, which are in their second generation. Although it tends to lag behind AMD and ARM in terms of manufacturing process (nm value), I think Intel is still superior in terms of architecture technology and instruction set. If you switch from Tiger Lake (11th generation) or lower, it's not a dream to double the performance, so you'll be amazed at the technological advances. The built-in GPU has 32 execution units (Tiger Lake's i5 1135G7 has 80), so it should be considered a bonus. If you have any desire to play games, feel free to add a video card. However, it is convenient to be able to output to a monitor without a video card. These days, even the i5 costs 35,000 yen due to the weak yen, which is annoying. In the past, you could have bought an i7 for the same price. . . Nowadays, there are no cheap motherboards that cost around 5,000 yen, and even cheap ones cost 15,000 yen, so the CPU + motherboard alone costs 50,000 yen. . . Still, I think it was a good purchase. [Added on 2023/10/29] As a result of replacing the CPU cooler and not being tied to TDP65W... I think it can't be helped because it's like OCing a rated 65W CPU ignoring the power limit, but when I was using GIGABYTE B760M DS3H DDR4 with TDP 125W setting, the CPU voltage exceeded 1.4V. The operation becomes unstable. It will be stable if you use it at a CPU voltage of about 1.3V with TDP 100W setting. It seems better not to use it on motherboards that want to increase the CPU voltage too much."
intel-i5-13500,5,October/2023,amazon,"Intel is the best! ! It's sold and shipped by a famous parts shop, so there's no chance of the package being opened and only the CPU missing."
intel-i5-13500,5,December/2023,amazon,"This was my first purchase, so I can't compare it to others, but it was wrapped securely so it wouldn't get loose in the shipping box. It arrived one day earlier than the scheduled date, which is helpful."
intel-i5-13500,5,October/2023,amazon,"I bought it for my own use considering the specs and heat generation, and considering the recent price hike, I should have bought it sooner. Although it's a 13th generation, it's actually a 12th generation, but it comes with 8 E cores, ma'am. Well, thanks to that, the power consumption has increased, but the performance per watt is not bad, and more than that, it works well in situations where multi-core is required. The PC configuration is this CPU, the motherboard is MSI B760 Tomahawk, the CPU cooler is MSI MPG CORELIQUID K240 V2, the memory is 3600MHz 16G x 2, the case is Thermaltake H570, and the case fan is Thermalright TL-C12CW-S. I installed three on the front and one on the rear, and installed a K240 radiator on the top. The image is the usual Cinebench R23, and the score is almost the same as what you see on the internet. The maximum temperature inside the bench is 65 degrees Celsius, so simple water cooling will be enough to cool it, or rather, if you don't remove power restrictions, I think air cooling will be enough for someone of a certain level. If you go to 13600K, which is one rank higher, the heat generation will increase considerably for the price, so I think this spec is sufficient for usage that does not require that much CPU. The rating is 5 stars, which is very satisfying."

I have been using the Magix editing program for a long time. If my old PC could do it, it should be able to do much more as it has been since the program does not require so many resources. At the moment I am very happy with it. heatsink that everyone hates the original one that comes with the processor when I edit every tablet see if it heats up not at the moment no I just want to give a slap on the ear to whoever it may be since the box arrived unsealed for criticizing it Amazon has not published two reviews prior to assembly of the same, the processor was forgotten, it was assembled with the suggestion plate that is sold, part secures the processor with four screws to prevent it from bending, I recommend it to the since and to enjoy with this configuration"

The motherboard is MSI MAG Z790 TOMAHAWK WIFI DDR4 The graphics card is RTX3060ti The memory is DDR4 3200 The power supply is 850Wm.2 is gen4 The 1TB cooler does not have to be updated as far as air cooling is concerned, but maintains about 80% of the specs and updates any areas of concern. I feel like this is the first time I've done it in a while. It's very crispy and I have no complaints and I'm grateful for the times."

intel-i5-13600k,5,September/2023,amazon,"Asuka bench with stable diffusion at 13600k and 4070ti takes 15 seconds. Considering that it was 24 seconds with Ryzen5 1600 and 4070ti, I think the CPU is also important for comfort with generated AI. I wonder if the change from DDR4 2400MHz to DDR5 6000MHz has something to do with the good response. I'm glad I took the plunge and bought it because I can multitask while generating."
intel-i5-13600k,5,February/2023,amazon,"My previous computer was an i7, but the i5 has better performance than that, so I don't have any problems with it. However, if you purchase only the CPU, there is a risk that Amazon will deliver it in a paper bag these days, so I purchased the motherboard and memory at the same time, but I was surprised that the CPU box was not fixed and arrived in the paper bag even though it is the same as the motherboard. did. On top of that, the memory was sent separately via Yu-Mail, and to my surprise, everything was recognized safely, so I'm glad, but I don't want to give it 5 stars because I think the product includes shipping."

intel-i5-13600k,5,January/2023,amazon,"I'm not very familiar with it so I can't give a professional review, but I can use it reliably. I mainly use it to work with Adobe Illustrator. I don't know how much Illustrator work depends on GPU and memory, but the CPU temperature never exceeds 30 degrees and I can work smoothly even with slightly heavy data. I thought the price was a little high for an i5, but I saw information on performance that can compete with the 12th generation i7, so I guess it can't be helped. Other specs are for reference only: Gravo 3070TI, memory DDR4-3600MHz 64GB."
intel-i5-13600k,5,January/2023,amazon,"I use it with 13600k, RTX3060, and AK620. For those who are planning to use the full performance, we recommend simple water cooling from the beginning. I think air cooling is fine for people who just need instantaneous power for a short time (such as when starting a video)."
intel-i5-13600k,5,November/2022,amazon,"I wasn't too dissatisfied with the speed of the old Core i7 6700K, but since it doesn't run on Windows 11, I thought it was time to replace it, so I decided to use the latest CPU. I was torn between the i7 13700K, but chose this one considering heat dissipation and cost performance. It feels fast enough for someone like me who doesn't do much heavy processing. I've managed to cool it down with an air-cooled CPU cooler (Noctua NH-D15S), and I don't think I'll appreciate it much even if it's about 20% faster, so I think this was the right choice. As a side note, the fact that Windows 10 started up as is even after replacing almost the entire PC, and that I was able to easily update to Windows 11 was a surprise to those who remember having trouble with it in the old days."

intel-i7-13700k,5,August/2023,amazon,playing valorant competitive setting average fps
intel-i7-13700k,5,April/2023,amazon,"I've heard that air cooling doesn't exhaust all the heat, but I can exhaust the heat normally. I don't know if it's overloaded, but... It's fine if you just use the browser or play games."
intel-i7-13700k,5,January/2023,amazon,"If you turn it around 250W with no power limit, the i7 12700K won't be a rival and can easily beat the i9 12900K, but as others have said, it gets too hot... However, even if you just set it to 190W (same as the i7 12700K) It is an amazing CPU that surpasses the i9 12900K, and the performance degradation itself is only a few percent, so I (simple water cooling) am satisfied with operating it at 190W. If you definitely want to use air cooling (large size), I think you can cool it with around 140W without any problem, and you can operate it with low power while still being much stronger than the i7 12700K. Conclusion: If you limit the power, the CPU has the best performance per watt and generates less heat. It seems like Intel has wasted a lot of power in order to compete with rival CPUs."
intel-i7-13700k,5,December/2022,amazon,"It was originally a replacement for the 7th generation i7-7700k. Performance has improved significantly! ! I'm very satisfied ☺ I run a lot of distribution software at the same time, and so far I haven't had any problems with the processing performance. However, it retains heat easily. I don't know if it can be cooled with air cooling...I use simple water cooling! For your reference!"
intel-i7-13700k,5,November/2022,amazon,"I was torn between the top model, the Core i9-13900k, but chose this Core i7-13700k, which has the same number of cores and improved peak performance and performance per watt. I am using a Z690 motherboard, but if the BIOS supports it, there is no problem. Modern motherboards can update their BIOS with just a power supply, so there are often no problems with non-compatible BIOSes. We recommend that you update (or download for new installation) device drivers to the latest version in advance. Cinebench R23 score is 30552 for multi and 2082 for single. The score has increased by about 10% from the Core i9-12900K, and the power consumption at full load is about 30W lower, which is a good feeling. I think it's doing well with 10nm and process rules that are two to three generations down compared to other companies' current products, but I think that the point that a 360mm simple water cooler is essential remains unchanged from Alder Lake, and the evaluation will be divided. Honestly, the watt performance at full load is a bit strange. I installed it this time for a gaming PC, so it doesn't encode videos, so I'm personally very satisfied. If you're mainly doing encoding processing, we recommend the Ryzen 9 5950X, which is an older model that works fine with a large air cooler, but is easier to handle and cheaper. If you are mainly playing games, we recommend the Core i7-13700k, which has high single-thread performance, as it has high performance per watt and cost performance!"
intel-i7-13700k,5,May/2024,amazon,"Immediately after assembly, a blue screen occurred due to overheating, and in order to confirm the actual situation, I replaced the water cooling memory, replaced the graphics card, and replaced the power supply, but there was no improvement at all, and I tried replacing it with the i5 1360KF that I bought at the same time, but the CPU was the cause. It was discovered that I couldn't figure it out as soon as it arrived, and since it was an expensive purchase, the warranty period was too short, and the CPU wasn't cheap, so it was still a long time before I had to buy a new one, and the games I could play were limited, which was the worst part."
intel-i7-13700k,5,October/2022,amazon,"29832 with cineR23 bench multi. GPU is RTX2060Super. Memory is 64GB. DDR4FF14 bench is a 4K high quality result. On the cineR23 bench, the core with the highest temperature was around 89℃. Uses Cooler Master simple water cooling MLW-D36M-A18PA-R2 FN1403. To prevent warping, we changed the original CPU bracket to an aluminum bracket fixed with 4 screws. The aluminum bracket for 12th generation can be used as is. It may be said that it is required. It seems that the recommendation is simple water cooling or higher, but since the temperature will drop to around 40 degrees Celsius as soon as R23 cycles are completed, a larger air cooling system with good cooling efficiency may be sufficient. For long periods of high load such as exporting videos, it will be difficult to use a simple water cooling device of 360 mm or more."
intel-i7-13700k,5,January/2023,amazon,"Seriously fast. That's all. However, with the air cooling I have, the Cine Bench R23's score is only 24,000. When I look at the clock, it hovers around 4GHz. How to cool a high-performance CPU is the key to demonstrating its ability. I now think that the i5 might have been better if it was air-cooled. P.S. The score increased from 24000 to 29000 by introducing triple simple water cooling. Cooling methods are really important."

intel-i9-13900k,5,April/2024,amazon,"As others have written, it is extremely fast and extremely hot. In my case, I use a DeepCool LT720 water cooler, and the CPU temperature is around 48 degrees when I'm not doing any heavy processing. I haven't used it for any heavy-duty processing yet, so I'll report back."
intel-i9-13900k,5,March/2024,amazon,"I've been buying i9 ever since the i9 series was released, but this time it's even more exciting. It has 24 cores, 32 threads, and 5.8Ghz specifications, and the motherboard vendor also defaults to unlimited power, so even with 360mm simple water cooling, it can reach 100 degrees Celsius in seconds using benchmark software. However, if you lower the voltage a bit, you can operate not only 360mm simple water cooling but also high-end air cooling without degrading performance. Each motherboard vendor has their own settings, but since I use MSI, I use Lite Load. As a result, even when playing CPU-intensive games such as Cyberpunk 2077 on the Noctua D-15, it can be kept at a maximum of 75 degrees Celsius at 4K 60 fps at a room temperature of around 27 degrees Celsius. If you use full threads, I think it will be difficult for high-end air cooling even if you lower the voltage. In that case, I think water cooling of 360mm or more is better. For gaming purposes, you can use high-end air cooling if you follow the steps above. We recommend this as it is an all-purpose, super high-performance CPU that is easy to use with a little tweaking."
intel-i9-13900k,5,November/2022,amazon,"Offset -1.00, ASRock Z790 Pro RS/D4 BIOS 360mm Simple water cooling setting 265W limited multi: 40403 Single: 2285 Maximum temperature: 70 degrees Measured for 10 minutes to confirm error → No error Multi: 40215 Maximum temperature: 77 degrees 150W limited multi : 34265 Single: 2286 Maximum temperature: 55 degrees Despite the lower voltage, the single performance did not fluctuate in the slightest. It is often said that it is extremely hot, but I think that is the way it is operated."
intel-i9-13900k,5,December/2022,amazon,"I was considering using a silent CPU fan (Noctua NH-D15), but the temperature exceeded 100 degrees under continuous high load. By introducing simple water cooling (Celsius S36), we are now able to maintain a temperature of 80 degrees. Those considering air cooling should be careful. Geekbench 5 ScoreSingle-Core Score: 2164Multi-Core Score: 21335"
intel-i9-13900k,5,January/2023,amazon,"You can easily use air cooling (a 5,000 yen cooler for thermal lights) by just tweaking the voltage a little. Even after applying load for about 10 minutes, it stays around 80 degrees. It doesn't get very hot when playing games. Due to the voltage limit, R23's bench score was around 37,000, but since it was used for gaming, it did not affect it. By the way, if you use water cooling, the voltage will be around 40,000 because you can increase the voltage a little more. The LGA1700 had a problem with the CPU warping, but I put a thin washer on the screw part of the socket and checked it with a light and a ruler, and there was no problem at all."
intel-i9-13900k,5,April/2024,amazon,It arrived earlier than expected which was helpful!
intel-i9-13900k,5,January/2024,amazon,"I'm currently using a Core i9 9900K, but the responsiveness has decreased considerably under the latest Windows 11 Pro. We can't expect much improvement with the CPU speed of 3.0Ghz of ""13th generation Core i9-13900K BOX"", right? When improving the environment, I would like to select a CPU speed of 6.0Ghz."
intel-i9-13900k,5,December/2022,amazon,"I switched from 12900KF and bought it on Cyber ​​Monday at the end of last month, but when I saw it the other day, it was over 8,000 yen cheaper, and even considering the campaign points, I bit my lip because it would have been much better to wait a little longer lolRaptor lake TDP limits are worth it! ! I've read a lot of review articles, so I'm limiting it to 253W for the first time, but with TDP 253W limit and RAM test, all cores average 4.6GHz (P core 5.1GHz E core 4.2GHz CPU) At a temperature of 65℃ to 79℃ (room temperature 19℃), the system power consumption was about 280W according to Watt Checker.I was surprised that even on a continuous bench of Cineben R23, the maximum package temperature was around 80℃ under an environment of room temperature of 20℃. Still, the score is over 36000. Compared to Alder Lake, it is significantly improved. Thanks to this, air cooling is possible without compromising performance. If you are buying an LGA1700 CPU now, you are wrong. I can confidently say that Raptor Lake is the recommended CPU."
intel-i9-13900k,5,February/2023,amazon,"In the past, when I built a home-built PC with an emphasis on GPUs and upgraded the CPU to a cheap i3, I was frustrated by the fact that game support was refused even though the gameplay was fine, and more and more games wouldn't start even after I bought them. I put a heavy emphasis on CPU and attached a suitable graphics card. After that, the number of games that I can't start even though my FF15 bench score hasn't changed has decreased significantly. However, even if I cooled this 360mm CPU with simple water cooling, thermal throttling occurred in Cinebench, but when I set the core voltage to -0.1V with Offset, thermal throttling did not occur and the score increased by 200."
intel-i9-13900k,5,November/2022,amazon,It's good to regularly use the performance that you can't reach even if you OC the old i5 and 7. Super π 1.04 million digits 4 seconds.

intel-i9-13900k,1,June/2023,amazon,"First of all, I have to say that the delivery was really quick, the date was planned for the following week on Wednesday, but the package arrived on Friday. I thought it would be great to get all the parts together and start assembling, so I started unpacking the mainboard, everything was nicely laid out and I wanted to then unpacking the cpu, I was surprised because the packaging was already open, I thought, but no matter what, I opened the packaging where the cpu should be in it and saw a hint of nothing, great, I thought away, I guess there's someone in the Amazon warehouse like that In the self-service store I immediately called Amazon and not a minute later the email came saying that the amount would be refunded, everything was very strange and annoying but in the end it all turned out well for me. I have now ordered again from another provider and hope that there won't be another bad surprise gives"

intel-i5-12400f,5,January/2024,amazon,I am satisfied with the stable performance of the LGA1700 series.
intel-i5-12400f,5,January/2024,amazon,good
intel-i5-12400f,5,April/2024,amazon,Appropriate goods
intel-i5-12400f,5,December/2023,amazon,"Along with the motherboard, I replaced the CPU from an i9 9900k. In terms of performance, it's a little different from the 9th generation i9, but since it's brand new, it's much more comfortable to use. I sometimes use OBS for streaming, but so far I haven't experienced any inconvenience. It was a good purchase"
intel-i5-12400f,5,November/2023,amazon,"It's easy to use, the delivery was fast, and I would use it again!"
intel-i5-12400f,5,April/2023,amazon,The LGA1700 CPU is so fast! ? It would be a waste if I didn't use RTX30 series or higher.
intel-i5-12400f,5,February/2023,amazon,"I bought it because it was less than 25,000 yen at the time of purchase. I bought this because I wanted to upgrade to a new PC (i5-2600k) that I had been using for a while. After watching someone's video on You Tube, I thought the i7-12400F would be a good option for the price I could afford, so I started looking into parts for it. For those who can afford a little more, I think the i5-13400F has better performance, but since I was replacing a CPU from 10 generations ago, I'm quite satisfied with this one as well. So far, it's stable even when I'm playing games, and it's cooling down enough even with a retail cooler, so I think I made a good purchase. I'm thinking of changing from GTX1060 to GTX 1060, but I feel like the price has been rising again since the end of February, so I'll wait and see until the middle class RTX 4000 series comes out. The games I mainly play are GGST, Monster Hunter Rise, and APEX, but I've lowered the settings so I don't have any problems at the moment, but I'd like to play them with good image quality if possible, so I hope they come out soon."
intel-i5-12400f,5,January/2024,amazon,"The i5-12400f could be a great CPU if it costs less than 20,000 yen."
intel-i5-12400f,5,June/2022,amazon,"Considering the price, you can play decent games, so if it's your first time making your own game, I think this price is good.I haven't had any problems so far, but I personally don't like the included CPU fan pins, and it doesn't stick well, so it takes a lot of time. Ta"
intel-i5-12400f,5,March/2022,amazon,"Embedded use with RTX 3060. Since it uses simple water cooling, it stays cool even under high loads. Although it is the most cost-effective CPU, the graphics card price is still high, which is a pain for homebrew PC players."
intel-i5-12400f,1,November/2023,amazon,"does not have a video controller, this does not allow the use of onboard video cards, this is not very clear in the product for sale"

intel-i3-12100f,5,February/2023,amazon,cpu probably one best budgie cpu money buy
intel-i3-12100f,5,January/2024,amazon,"I bought this because I could play games on this generation's i3 due to budget constraints. It's good because I can play games, but the processing load increases quickly and sometimes I can't keep up with the processing rate (94%), so I'm thinking of switching to an i5 from the same generation or the next generation. Other than that, I don't have any particular problems, so I think it's fine."
intel-i3-12100f,5,December/2023,amazon,The performance was as expected. I don't feel like using an older generation CPU.
intel-i3-12100f,5,November/2023,amazon,"The performance is comparable to that of previous generation top-class CPUs, so it's pretty good. If you use a combination of something like 4070Ti, there are many things that will work without causing that much of a bottleneck. With 4090, the processing cannot keep up, but it's still only a few percent down, so considering the power consumption, it's probably a good effort. Recommended if you want to easily and cheaply build a gaming PC"
intel-i3-12100f,5,August/2023,amazon,"I wanted a CPU Core i7, but it works well enough for me as I don't play games."
intel-i3-12100f,5,July/2023,amazon,"If you can play games or work to some extent, this is your choice."
intel-i3-12100f,5,July/2023,amazon,"It's a stable product made by Intel in terms of brand image, but it's as expected. It's okay to not have built-in graphics since it's a graphics card anyway, and it's the best balance between price and performance."
intel-i3-12100f,5,March/2023,amazon,"I'm very satisfied and have no complaints. If you jump from the Corei7-870 fossil to the 12th generation, there's no reason to complain. I've been using it for nearly 12 years without having to replace the CPU or motherboard, but it's so comfortable that I can't stand it anymore. Motherboard/ASUS TUF GAMING B660M-PLUS D4 Memory/Crucial 16GB (8GBx2) DDR4 3200MT/s(PC4-25600) CL22 UDIMM 288pin CT2K8G4DFRA32A"
intel-i3-12100f,5,January/2023,amazon,"There was no graphics output, and the motherboard I purchased at the same time was (as it turned out) a defective product, so it took a lot of effort to find out that the motherboard was the cause. I realized again that it is good to have a graphics output even if it is a little expensive. After replacing the motherboard, it is working without any problems. It has low fever."
intel-i3-12100f,5,December/2023,amazon,numeric calculation
intel-i3-12100f,5,June/2023,amazon,"If it were true, I wanted to go for the COREi5 class, but due to budget reasons, I went for this product. Even so, the processing speed seems to be higher than before due to the increased operating frequency etc. I'm thinking of replacing it when I have the budget in the future."
intel-i3-12100f,5,October/2023,amazon,"I can only recommend this CPU for gaming, why because most games only use core, the F is perfect for economical final performance, I use this CPU connection with an Rxxt and play Far Cry Ultra setting with fps, the CPU is extremely economical, a super fast combination"
intel-i3-12100f,5,February/2023,amazon,"The CPU has more than enough power for all office applications and doesn't even get lukewarm in normal operation. It's great technology at a reasonable price. Installing a suitable mainboard LGA is child's play and is foolproof. A dedicated graphics card is required in the sister model. A pretty good graphics solution is already on it Chip is available and is sufficient for practically all office work. For normal users, the additional euros are well spent and are worth it for the electricity bill alone"

intel-i3-12100f,5,14 mars 2023,amazon,"I bought this processor to build a gaming PC for my son and I am very satisfied with it, it is hard to beat the value for money, the processor in this version f does not have a graphics chip, so you have to buy a separate graphics card, this f only has four cores and eight threads. which can limit its performance in heavier tasks like video rendering or high-level gaming It does not support overclocking which means you will not be able to increase the clock speed of the processor beyond its base specifications but this price remains a solid choice for those on a budget looking to build a base setup on the latest Intel platform"

intel-i5-12600k,5,January/2024,amazon,"I was surprised when it showed up as being delivered even though it hadn't arrived (delivered?...not), but then it changed to being in transit and there was a considerable delay, but it was delivered safely. Not only this, but the D15S's 17XX compatible mount kit was temporarily missing, and it took nearly a month to get all the parts, so I seriously considered changing the configuration. Although it was a difficult birth, the resulting PC was stable from the beginning compared to the ASUS Z790-PD4CSM+i5-13600K configuration, which had nightmares of blue, black screens, and freezes, and the blue screen only appeared when running OC + Cinebench R23 (◎). The PC configuration is MB ASROCK Z690 PRO RS + CPU (this) + memory CFD DDR4 3200 16G x 2 + CPU cooler D15S plus 12cm fan (diverted s), omitted below. Cinebench R23's power unlimited (maximum 5G㎐), long time 65W * short time 120W * peak temperature 62℃, the respective values ​​are ASUS Z790+i5-13600K configuration 23000*18000, this about 18000*13000, 78* each The performance is about 72%. Performance-wise, there's nothing worth looking at, but it's much quieter when the power is unlimited, and this seems to be largely due to the differences in the thinking of the MB manufacturer, PC case, and CPU cooler used. The performance is sufficient for use in the dining room, so I have no complaints, but I'm a little disappointed that the certification didn't pass and I had to buy the 11Pro. (packaged version). Currently, 13,600K is about 47,000 yen, 78% of this is 36,600 yen, 72% is about 33,840 yen, and the CP value is even. It was 31,028 yen at the time of purchase, and even if you had to spend a few hundred yen on the phone bill to confirm its location, it was a good value for money at the time, but at the current selling price, you won't regret it if you choose the 13,600K even if you go overboard. I think you should choose another CPU. The φ120 fan (93.97CFM) in the image has a lower CPU temperature when placed at the rear than at the front, which resulted in the placement of the image. 2023/01/03 Addendum I can't read the image numbers on the 4K screen, so I replaced it with an FHD one."

intel-i5-12600k,5,January/2023,amazon,"There is a great sense of stability. The performance level is as expected. However, although the performance has nothing to do with it, I don't like the shape. Why did you make it this way?"
intel-i5-12600k,5,January/2023,amazon,Data processing is fast and easy to handle
intel-i5-12600k,5,October/2022,amazon,Good things that have been said enough
intel-i5-12600k,5,July/2022,amazon,"This is my first homebrew in 10 years. Until now, I have been using an Intel Corei7 5820K (6 Core 12 thread) system. Since I'm not interested in games, I thought I didn't need a corei7 or higher CPU, so I chose this CPU. This is my impression after assembling it and using it in a Windows 10 environment. Windows starts up quickly. Windows Update time has become considerably shorter. Even if you run youtube on 3 screens at the same time, the CPU load is less than 10%. Therefore, the CPU temperature hardly rises (using Kotetsu MK2). The CPU usage of each core is not even compared to the previous CPU. I don't really understand the operating specifications of E-core on Windows 10. The built-in graphics are quite good (using two 4K Monitor Displays). I plan to upgrade to Windows 11 in the future, but I will continue to use it as is for a while."

intel-i5-12600k,5,May/2022,amazon,hello this processor is not the most efficient of the brand but it offers the best value for money
intel-i5-12600k,5,September/2022,amazon,I put it in a surrounding configuration and it is perfect in all tasks
intel-i5-12600k,4,August/2023,amazon,The only problem is that the thermal paste is missing. I went to buy it in a store otherwise it's perfect.
intel-i5-12600k,2,September/2023,amazon,good super for the price but sold as a box so you don't hear it with a cooler which is not the case
intel-i5-12600k,5,March/2024,amazon,"truly phenomenal processor unlocked and probably capable of providing even superior performance, all very nice if it weren't for the fact that at least this example was unable to make the first PCIe in all cases and bios settings it was not possible to use the first slot while the other slots were used correctly and for example in the second pcie slot the video card was recognized it only worked gen x you will understand that using a video card with perhaps a quarter of its potential is unacceptable excellent Amazon as always has bad luck in making returns every now and then"
intel-i5-12600k,5,November/2021,amazon,"finally something that gives meaning to Intel's medium range previously dominated by AMD with excellent performance at a fair price. I used this processor coupled with the new unfortunately expensive DDR RAM and with window. Intel recommends not using window, in fact window to make the most of the new architecture of the twelfth gen and I found myself really well in all areas of photo processing, photoshop and lightroom, gaming, programming thanks to the new Intel architecture, I managed to show off its muscles again on the single core, obtaining excellent scores thanks to a significantly improved IPC compared to the old one on many tasks and photoshop operations I really noticed how the waiting time was halved thanks to the really high frequencies in multicore it also behaves really well exporting many photos with lightroom from raw jpg the pc remains fluid and efficient without sending shots any other activity process also running on lightroom I I was able to appreciate the great single core efficiency, especially when I apply a preset in numerous photos. Consumption is not at AMD's levels. This generation has certainly made a big leap forward in terms of the consumption-performance ratio because it's true that it consumes more than a Ryzen. It's also true that more powerful than the latter, almost all tests, some by a lot, others by a little, I tried some overclocking configurations and I must say that it is easy to set really high frequencies on the high performance p cores, significantly increasing the performance, however I do not recommend having the card manage the voltage mother because unfortunately ghz offered me values ​​that were unnecessarily high and not suitable for the longevity of the CPU itself. in conclusion, I found myself really well. I came from K and the performance leap can be felt in every area in which I use the PC. The price trend will be the real tip of the balance when deciding on this CPU. as a best buy in the medium range because the performance is there, the technology is there too and finally consumption also seems to have improved. I hope this review has been useful to you."

intel-i7-12700k,5,May/2023,amazon,"My CPU is quite old, so I upgraded it for the first time in 12 years. At first I was hesitant about RYZEN, but in the end I decided to buy this one.

intel-i7-12700k,5,August/2022,amazon,"When I installed a new motherboard and started it up, there was a red light near the CPU LED on the motherboard? Is it broken?"
intel-i7-12700k,5,April/2022,amazon,"The configuration is Mother: MSI MAG Z690 TOMAHAWK WIFI DDR4 Graphics: RTX3080 12G memory: PC4-21300DDR4-2666 (used in Memory Try It! with 3200) The number of PCIe lanes of the CPU is 20, so I installed M2 in the graphics (x16) C drive. 1 NVMeSSD (x4) *I don't really understand the specifications of the chipset, but I think it's okay to add M2.NVMe since the DMI bus is used instead of the PCIe bus from the CPU to the chipset. However, this configuration is not particularly necessary. I don't want to reduce the lifespan of NVMe with the system cache, so I used an old SSD of 250G, which is not used exclusively for the system cache, with a SATA connection. (Writing the system cache on the SSD will shorten its lifespan, but I will not use it, so I use it.) Two internal HDDs are connected to SATA and are externally connected to M2.In the case of converting NVMe to USB-C, the SSD is 250G dedicated to the connected system cache. used with SATA connection. I attached a simple water-cooled CPU cooler 360mm iCUE H150i ELITE CAPELLIX, but it was too cold, so I think 240mm would have been better. FINAL FANTASY 7784"

Since I didn't have the budget for a graphics card, I'm still using the 1050Ti, so it's holding me back and I'm not using the CPU's full potential, but it still makes Adobe startup and editing easier. I would like to change Grabo and finish it in the future."
intel-i7-12700k,5,December/2021,amazon,"It's cooler than the 12900K, consumes less power, and is about 20,000 yen cheaper.As for gaming performance, the 12900K beats the average fps by about 6fps in full HD, and the average fps of the 12700k is fairly high compared to the 5900X.If you use WQHD or 4k, you can get that much fps with the CPU. Even with DDR4, the difference remains the same, the 12700K is higher than the 5900X in almost every score.To summarize, it is the strongest CPU at a price of 50,000 yen, beating the 5950X in single play and the 5900X in multi play.I only play games = 12600K games Of course, but I also do various other things = 12700K I want to play games and do various things without worrying about heat generation, and I want the strongest CPU = 12900K By the way, I use Noctua's U12A black for 12700K 12900K It seems to be tough, but the 12700K can be cooled normally at a room temperature of 26 degrees (Cinebench R23 does not reach 80 degrees in 10 minutes) It easily defeats the previous generation Intel's strongest 11900K, beats the 5900X, and beats the 5950X with a single score.The 12700K is no longer an enemy. None"

intel-i9-12900k,5,November/2023,amazon,very good
intel-i9-12900k,5,June/2022,amazon,"Purchased in May 2022. Operated with ASUS simple water cooling (ROG240mm). I gave up on 360mm because the case is old. Under rated usage, the CPU temperature can be maintained in the low 80s when encoding H.265. Overclocking since it's a Z690 mother. Up to 6 cores will run at a magnification of 54. The temperature should reach 90 degrees Celsius. The voltage is -0.05V at offset. In this case, the power consumption did not reach 241W based on Core temp reading. However, just by tweaking all cores and setting the magnification to 50, it consumes nearly 300W and the CPU temperature instantly rises to 100℃. Thermal throttling will be activated immediately. All tests were conducted at a room temperature of 27°C. Even if you use simple water cooling with 360mm, I don't think you can control the temperature that rises to 100℃ in an instant, so if you don't want to hit thermal throttling, overclocking may be difficult. I thought. If it is a single core, it is stable at 54 times, so I am satisfied. I was upgrading from a 6700K, but when I encoded a 10 minute video to H.265, it took about 15 minutes for the 6700K and about 7 minutes for the 12900K. I feel the times are changing. Even when editing videos with Premiere Pro (8 streams of 4K), all cores did not reach full power. I guess it's only when I encode and when I turn the bench. It does generate heat, but for everyday use it can also be operated with 240mm simple water cooling."
intel-i9-12900k,5,April/2022,amazon,"I bought it for a gaming PC, overclocked the P core to 5.2GHz, and use it regularly. It's a pretty good CPU if you can handle the heat well. However, I haven't spent the summer yet, so I'm a little worried about the future, but I'm satisfied with the current situation."
intel-i9-12900k,5,March/2022,amazon,"The CPU isn't that hot unless you put an unusual load on it with benchmarks etc. 360 mm is ideal, but I feel like you can go with 280 mm for normal use.As expected, if you run the bench forever, the fractal design uses 360 mm radio. Without the hole in the top of the quiet case, the temperature rises to more than 90 degrees, but I don't worry about it because I understand that there is no problem with the CPU as long as it does not exceed 100 degrees.The power consumption during idling is low as it is with INTEL after all. It's a CPU that is said to be a washer lake, but it processes quickly and doesn't get too hot during normal use, so I don't think it's something to panic about."
intel-i9-12900k,5,January/2023,amazon,low binned cpu bad cpu score
intel-i9-12900k,5,March/2024,amazon,"The other day, I bought it with the intention of assembling my own PC, and when I asked a certain PC shop to assemble it on my behalf, I was told that it could not be used because the CPU was broken, so I returned it! In the end, I bought a new CPU at that store and the problem was solved! Don't send your parents! Do not be silly! I thought"
intel-i9-12900k,5,April/2022,amazon,"The product I received was 12900KS.This is not a product review, but please be careful when shipping."
intel-i9-12900k,5,December/2021,amazon,"It's a CPU that seems to have been overpowered in order to beat AMD. Get a 280mm, preferably 360mm radiator. Air cooling may be possible by lowering the clock. If you get serious about it, it will consume more than 240W. Make sure you have plenty of power. Probably most M/Bs require 8pin*2."
intel-i9-12900k,5,February/2022,amazon,"I bought it as a set at a certain place because it was cheap, but as everyone knows, the power supply area is quite tight. Still, DDR5 is too expensive and I ended up over budget♪ When combined with RTX3080, the CPU temperature during gaming is not as hot as it should be (obviously), but I can't tell at all how it feels compared to 11900k. If it's just a minor spec increase, I don't think it's necessary...I'm tired of it, so next time I'll go for the long-awaited ZEN4! Good luck Intel! They're way ahead of their time. Who is it lol"

intel-i9-12900k,5,November/2021,amazon,"The new Alder Lake CPUs from Intel now come with an NM process for the first time and have fundamental changes. The new CPUs work with a hybrid model and have integrated fast and slower efficient cores that coordinate with each other. So you can talk about cores because there are no efficient cores Hyper threading is ultimately used for cores and threads in games but it has no effect because the single core performance is very high and the k is the fastest gaming cpu currently also ddr and pcie are supported here for the first time on the market you need a z for the cpu Mainboard in terms of performance, Intel is at the top with Alder Lake and the K in single core applications, while the multi-core performance is only slightly behind the AMD Power consumption when playing games is on a par with the AMD models in terms of efficiency. Only under full load do the fast cores ultimately consume more power and then increase the power consumption so that the CPU then sometimes consumes significantly more than its competitors who often bring the CPU to the load limit and nothing limits it Will use more electricity here, but it probably doesn't bother everyone if you don't have hours of full load every day, then it's only a few cents or maybe a few euros difference on the electricity bill every month. Of course, you have to take into account that the high electricity consumption only comes about if you do that Cores are really fully utilized and in practice this will rarely or never be the case. When it comes to temperatures, the k can be a hothead when e reaches the load limit, then temperatures around c are also possible, although the cpu is not damaged and here too we are talking about that At full capacity in desktop operation or gaming you simply won't reach these temperatures. I recommend an AIO water cooling system for relaxed operation. The bottom line is that Intel has finally managed to leave the nm process and has set new standards with nm ddr and pcie and is doing so Technically, the CPU is again at the top in terms of everyday performance. Single core applications and games are again at the top and in terms of price, the CPU can also impress anyone who has no problem with higher power consumption and temperature load peaks, which are practically rare, but can access them without worry z board requires DDR is not necessary DDR is enough to be able to upgrade to the next CPU models from Intel later, you would be on the safe side with DDR as it has not yet been confirmed that the next CPU series will also support DDR"

intel-i9-12900k,5,November/2022,amazon,undoubtedly one of the best processors at the moment on the Intel side the price is quite high but the power makes you feel the passage on the DDR ram is in my opinion the best selling point and a real advancement for my setup very practical for carrying out life twitch without having to lose fps in game
intel-i9-12900k,5,February/2022,amazon,hello so what can I say I love this processor I edit videos and multitask streams and this processor works perfectly well I cool it with water cooling and I'll tell you everything the power well it's there I have it up to gz and it's stable but heats degrees with a msi k an adapter must be used I gave it go of ddr mhz and everything works perfectly I wanted to do a complete heat test for you so yes it heats if you play in multi task you can take one except if you want to do streaming or editing or have a monster of power the installation is easy I advise you if my opinion is useful to you thank you for saying it

intel-i9-12900k,5,January/2022,amazon,"finally Intel has remembered that it produces processors that are undoubtedly at the top both in terms of price and performance, and in any case it is a niche processor dedicated to the most extreme builds who really need great performance, weak points, consumption and temperatures, another sore point, lack of compatible heatsinks, serious problems in finding components to complete Assembling the PC, I highly recommend high-end air or liquid cooling for the build and build phases."

intel-i5-11600k,5,October/2022,amazon,"When I set the recommended settings on an ASUS motherboard, the maximum rating of 4.9GHz was automatically changed to 5.1GHz, but it is working stably."
intel-i5-11600k,5,October/2022,amazon,with this generation of processors intel wanted to focus on the increase in raw power having already capitalized on the work done at the ipc terminus we are talking about a processor that makes a clear leap in productivity that still manages to achieve higher game performance despite the increase in boost frequency being significantly more moderate compared to to higher-end processors a frequency reached by all cores which can be pushed mhz with a click and with more than acceptable temperatures with a heatsink as soon as we are in short in front of a processor which is also very interesting for content creators and for those looking for the better relationship between price and overall computing powerprompt increase in performance of mid-range processorsexcellent gaming performancegood overclocking marginscountersensitive increase in purchase price for the platformPCLE lines are only those of the CPUconsumption and temperatures significantly increased
intel-i5-11600k,5,June/2021,amazon,"the processor arrived well packaged and quick like all k series not equipped with a heatsink I used my trusty noctua if still compatible after more than years since its release idle the cpu just degrees above room temperature and under prolonged load with the default settings of the Asrock H Steel Legend motherboard reaches the maximum CIL Turbo Boost brings the GHZ CPU to a single GHZ core on all six nuclei. The performance is remarkable and makes the use of the PC fluid and without slowdowns with all the software I have tested, both from work and Adobe. lightroom and photoshop both in games, support for the new AVX floating point instructions and deep learning boost give a notable performance advantage in recently compiled applications. This core th solution compared to the more antiquated Ryzen platform"
intel-i5-11600k,5,February/2024,amazon,Everything OK
intel-i5-11600k,5,October/2021,amazon,"I purchased this product for its quality. The Intel series goes hand in hand with the latest MB gaming chipsets. The combination allows for optimal use of the PCIe bus, especially for latest generation discs, allowing me to take advantage of a reading speed of MB and reading speed. of MB considering the arrival of window which optimizes these disks, a th generation processor must have a superior quality ratio compared to competitors"
intel-i5-11600k,4,December/2021,amazon,"what can I say, a best buy for gaming for those who want to assemble a PC at a low cost, a really nice fast processor that goes up to ghz, being a processor from the Intel K line, for less experienced overclockers, just activate the automatic overclock from the bios and it will manage everything for maximum performance and maximum stability, excellent value for money, there are many reviews online where they all speak well of it, the only one I've come across, it doesn't depend on mine, the heatsink I've mounted, it seems like all this power has an offer on the temperature. and it seems a little exaggerated to me, perhaps it will just be my obsession to be careful which heatsink you place next to it"
intel-i5-11600k,5,September/2022,amazon,for the best compromise of the th generation I have been using it for a stable year it does not suffer from the load of the heaviest jobs excellent for video and photo editing and in gaming it shows muscles excellent temperatures and consumption
intel-i5-11600k,5,April/2022,amazon,"I come from an AMD FX so we're talking about a notable change, this processor is a bomb, after all, Intel always recommend processors with a K in the code and a high TDP if you want significant performance in the choice of processors, excellent shipping and advance payment, I'm very satisfied"
intel-i5-11600k,5,December/2021,amazon,arrived with a slightly battered box they should send with something better in the end it didn't seem open k an excellent processor purchased at a discount of a good euro it runs well and doesn't cause any problems with a good liquid heatsink it maintains itself and is excellent for gaming if you don't want to spend too much
intel-i5-11600k,4,March/2022,amazon,for a good processor and it does its job very well the only problem is the energy consumption which is close to full load and for gaming I also found it very good the fps remain constant and the graphics quality of the integrated card is not bad I would recommend taking it given the price difference the one with the integrated graphics card therefore the k model and not the kf
intel-i5-11600k,1,May/2024,amazon,product arrived used dirty with thermal paste
intel-i5-11600k,2,July/2022,amazon,product described as used in excellent condition in reality it is scratched in an anomalous manner on the upper and lower edges as shown in the photo as if it had been assembled and disassembled several times I changed the fan to an old and clean one with dissipating paste it was immaculate so even more anomalous is that wear on the product object also by entering serial numbers on the Intel website I discovered that they already had a good year behind them with only years of Intel warranty Intel has years of warranty on the CPUs in light of this the risk of having a cooked processor on my hands is high and I have preferred to make it the most correct description would be processor in fair condition
intel-i5-11600k,2,November/2021,amazon,"the product arrived on time within the indicated time the only flaw was the box arrived half open ruined I couldn't understand if it was wrinkled during transport of a returned product fortunately the processor showed no signs for the moment I assembled it and it seems to work I didn't return it as I needed it assemble the PC as soon as possible, the matter remains that for delicate products that are not cheap, more attention would be needed both in transport and/or in preparation for shipping. This time the product sold and shipped by Amazon was not up to par. Update. After testing for a few days, I verified that the CPU heats up excessively. carrying out some tests with Aida it touches temperatures close to degrees I have a Noctua heatsink with fans from and I also tried with an open case it could be an unfortunate faulty CPU or a feature of this th generation at this point I think I will return it and try with another platform"

intel-i5-11600k,5,November/2021,amazon,I would compare this eleventh generation processor to its big brother Intel IK since the power of the individual cores is the same if you want to save a little at the expense of having cores instead of this is the processor for you. In my PC I used a workstation heatsink and the temperatures are acceptable not perfect if you want to overclock I advise you to use a quality heatsink as this CPU can absorb more than w I hope I have been helpful

intel-i7-11700k,5,August/2023,amazon,It is operating normally with no initial defects.
intel-i7-11700k,5,July/2021,amazon,"I built a PC with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 10 years ago and was using it without any problems, but suddenly my PC (probably the motherboard) broke down and I had no choice but to build my own PC for the first time in a while. . (To keep costs down!) I had some knowledge in the past, but I had been left behind for a long time, and I didn't know anything, so I thought it would be fine to have the same configuration as someone else, so I looked it up, but there was not much information, and there were problems with the compatibility of the configuration, etc. I was worried about this a lot. Please use this as a reference if you find it useful in the future. Motherboard ASUS GAMING H570-PRO Memory CFD Sales PC4-25600(DDR4-3200) 16GB x 2 W4U3200PS-16GATX Power Supply Silverstone 750W SST-ET750-HG-RevUFCPU Cooler Built-in Kotetsu Mark II SSD Samsung 980 1TB PCIe Gen 3.0 x4 There are no particular problems with the combination of NVMe M.2 MZ-V8V1T0B/EC or higher. It starts perfectly in one shot. The OS installation went well. Other than that, I used the DVD, HDD drive, PC case, etc. that I had on hand. Memory is running at 3200 natively. Currently, the settings are the default, but the temperature is much lower than expected, the startup speed and operation are extremely fast, and the stability is sufficient. This is a recommended combination."
intel-i7-11700k,5,May/2022,amazon,There are no initial defects and it works stably.
intel-i7-11700k,5,July/2021,amazon,"From a PC with i7-4790 to a PC with i7-11700K Install the first 11th generation CPU into ROG STRIX Z590F and build your own PC for the first time! I heard that it gets hot easily, so I tried setting it up with water cooling, but so far it hasn't exceeded 45 degrees Celsius, so I wonder if air cooling is okay if I'm not a person who does high-load work. If I don't do anything, the current temperature is about 36 degrees Celsius.With 32 GB of memory, the processing speed seems to be quite fast.The outer box is not damaged and I am glad I purchased it."
intel-i7-11700k,5,April/2023,amazon,"The one that was originally attached was a defective item (this was discovered after the initial defective response was overdone), but as the problem became noticeable, we arranged for a replacement. This was difficult to understand because 11700K and 11700 are different products. I canceled the order once, but when I looked at the inquiries, I found out that it was the product I was looking for, so I placed the order again. As for the product itself, I received the 11700K, so there is no problem with it, but I gave it a 4 star because the product name was difficult to understand."

intel-i7-11700k,5,October/2021,amazon,"Although the CPU was shipped from the USA and I was a bit short of time, the processor was delivered here a few days ago - of course without any problems"
intel-i7-11700k,5,June/2021,amazon,"So I actually wanted to buy a new AMD because the RRP prices were simply great for the performance. Then I saw an AMD processor with an RRP that was beyond good and bad I have a k and a k and both are technically great, even if they draw more power than the amd smy k. I can't get the air very cool over the long term and for me the sensible cpuder k is a little different up to w of course a stress test when watching the tube, on average when playing, it pulls a little more and depending on the game, it sometimes likes to stay at a good temperature, about degrees warmer than the k, both are cooled with noctua coolers, which are simply great in terms of performance There is hardly any noticeable difference when gaming. Unfortunately, I play on K with an RTX. Thanks to the modest GPU economy, it should actually be an RTX. You can notice the noticeable difference between the two CPUs when editing images or videos. I recommend K to everyone if you just want to play and save some money then a k or k is easily enough"
intel-i7-11700k,5,May/2021,amazon,"For me too, after five years of time, it was time to replace my old Intel IK core with something newer because it was simply getting on in years. After all, a lot has happened in five years and a core is actually no longer up to date after a long time of having it I then decided against AMD and again in favor of an Intel, even though opinions differ widely as to why the IC and not no AMD Ryzen, well the topic of AMD is no longer the same as it was a few years ago. It used to be Intel Premium and AMD are just the cheaper alternative, albeit often with more performance. Today this tide has somehow turned. AMD has turned the market completely upside down and Intel was then forced to reduce the prices appropriately. Today you could say AMD has the edge In the front, manufacturing technology, performance, etc. and Intel would be a bit behind. You can now see how you would like it. For my part, however, I consciously decided again in favor of one. Compared to the IK, a Ryzen xx would certainly be just as appropriate, if not even better or more powerful in some respects But since everything is just numbers from some benchmark and they play to me as an end user, the production technology whether nm or nm doesn't matter at all. The only advantage I see with AMD is the power consumption and therefore the power consumption as well as the rather low heat development Then ultimately a lower cooling is necessary and I personally can now see how he would like it. I have had the experience that the combination of CPUGPU and IntelVidia and or AMDradeon harmonize best today with AMD. I have often experimented and always ended up with an Intel system With an Nvidia graphics card, well, then it also depends on what I actually do with my computer. The area of ​​application is different for everyone and so are the requirements. I, for example, use my PC to work, so I earn my money so that I have reliability and stability as well as performance across the board, most importantly, I spend the rest of my time using it privately, including gaming every now and then. All in all, I need a reliable workhorse and in the years since I've been using Intel CPUs, like most recently the K, I haven't even had any problems with it since the first bi For the last day my system was purring away without a single crash or conflict of any kind. I can't deny that you can have the same thing with an AMD system, but I don't have the time or desire to experiment and therefore rely on experience So far I've had positive results with Intel and negative ones with AMD, price performance and all the hype about the details doesn't really matter to me. I can at least be sure that I know what I'm getting for my money, but anyone can and should Decide for yourself why exactly the ik the ik currently has the best price-performance ratio for me. I would probably have chosen the generation if I didn't necessarily want to benefit from PCI in the future. That alone already ensures a leap in comparison to my old k I not only bought the new CPU and motherboard, but also an SSD with a PCI connection and the new graphics card is currently an RTX super, which will probably be one with PCIe at some point, so I'm future-proof for now if you don't necessarily need it Or I would like to go for the generation, it doesn't make much of a difference, otherwise the IK offers me whole cores and threads, which is definitely enough for me. As an upgrade to my K with cores and threads, there is a significant increase in performance. You notice that immediately and that's exactly what it is In the end, you notice the additional performance instead of scrolling through some benchmark and worrying about paying your head, especially with the Adobe Creative Cloud Photoshop in Design Lightroom etc. and with regard to video editing Handbrake Davinci Resolve Adobe Premiere I noticed a significant improvement and that's exactly what I benefit from Expected Window Simply worth it as already mentioned, the only disadvantage that I personally see with AMD is the slightly higher consumption. Forget the numbers from any benchmark and rely on your experience and the noticeable increase in performance. If one of you also decides on the IK, I would definitely advise you to go for it Boxed fan from the fan that may be included with the purchase if you order the boxed version, it's better to go for the retail version and buy a decent CPU cooler separately. Your ears and your CPU will also thank you. For example, I use the Alpenfhn Ben Nevis Advanced and can use it I warmly recommend it, not only is it super quiet in operation, it also has a really extremely good cooling performance, no comparison to the crappy things you get with the CPU. Conclusion: I can absolutely recommend the IK for anyone who wants to put together a new PC within their budget Or just like me, if you want to replace a CPU that's getting a bit old, you definitely won't regret this decision and with the IK you'll certainly have a very stable, high-performance system for the next few years of the future. It's great for all kinds of tasks and can handle all of my tasks Perfect and without any problems from me so there are also stars. I was able to help you with the review and contribute to your purchasing decision. Thank you by clicking on useful soda will also help others"

I'm thinking of buying a compatible motherboard soon, disassembling the interior, and pulling out the CPU and other incomprehensible stones from inside.

intel-i3-10100,5,January/2024,amazon,"I bought this product and gave it to my son as a present because the motherboard of his PC (the LGA775 I was using) broke. At first, I thought it would be cheaper to buy a used LGA775 motherboard, but considering that I had new peripherals and Win11 installed, I made this choice. Since the LGA1700 and 12th generation CPU are still expensive, I think this motherboard and 10th generation core i3 would be best suited for my son. I'm glad I was able to keep the price down. Once my son starts earning money on his own, this motherboard is highly expandable, so I'm thinking of doing some research and adding a graphics card or replacing the CPU. I'm running win11 on a SATA6-connected SSD, but I'm looking forward to when I'll notice the existence of the M.2 slot. The GTS450 that I used before is not installed as a graphic, but is only built-in. I like that this product is suitable for beginners but is highly expandable."
intel-i3-10100,5,August/2023,amazon,"I replaced the hard disk with an SSD, and the trick from there was that when I plugged in a video card and used it, it became extremely fast."
intel-i3-10100,5,February/2023,amazon,"It can be used normally. I'm not playing games, so this is enough."
intel-i3-10100,5,April/2021,amazon,"I couldn't believe that the 11th generation would be released a month after I bought it. I can't help but be called a weak person. However, I am completely satisfied with the performance. I'm sure it will become obsolete in the future, so it will probably be a little cheaper, but unless you play heavy games or do work that requires heavy processing, you may be dissatisfied with this CPU-based configuration. I feel like there isn't. I was using Uncle Sandy's i5 notebook the other day, so I don't feel stressed at all anymore."
intel-i3-10100,4,January/2021,amazon,"I switched from Phenom (K10), and I think it's the perfect CPU for an internet-only machine that can consume as much as 10W of power under low load depending on the configuration. We recommend replacing your old computer with one. For my purposes, a Pentium is fine, but I'm glad I took the plunge and bought it because it has performance equivalent to the 6th and 7th generation i7 (6700k, 7700). With the intensification of competition due to the introduction of Ryzen, it is now a good time to get this performance at this price. The 10100 was a product of intensifying competition, and I felt that Intel was serious about it. The performance of 4 cores and 8 threads is not just for show. Intel's iGPU is said to have low performance, but its performance is more than enough for ordinary people who don't want to be fooled. It has better performance than the crappy graphics cards of a while ago, so you can play old or light games with ease. There's nothing wrong with AV1 decoding, but it can't be helped because of the generation."
intel-i3-10100,5,April/2021,amazon,ok
intel-i3-10100,5,July/2020,amazon,"Since it went from 4 cores and 4 threads to 4 cores and 8 threads, games at standard definition were comfortable if the graphics card was a GTX1650."
intel-i3-10100,4,June/2020,amazon,"According to Amazon information, it seems to work with Z390."
intel-i3-10100,5,September/2020,amazon,"The first machine is i7-Sandy. This is i3...the cruelty of the passage of time is felt in my heart. i3 is fast, I don't have any problems, this is fine."
intel-i3-10100,5,February/2021,amazon,I think it's good because it's stable.
intel-i3-10100,5,July/2020,amazon,"I used it in combination with ASUS's PRIME H470M-PLUS (MicroATX), but the fan noise from the included retail cooler bothered me, so I ended up replacing it with the i5-10400. The i3-10100's 3.6GHz, 4-core, 8-thread performance is perfect, and it runs smoothly and comfortably. I had no problems using Microsoft Office or watching videos. AMD seems to be selling better these days, but Intel still feels more secure when you consider its compatibility with various software. It might have been better to replace the retail cooler with a large-diameter cooler sold separately. Addendum: When I tried attaching the retail cooler (manufactured by NIDEC) that came with the i5-10400 to the i3-10100 using Silver Grease Arctic Silver 5, the fan of the cooler made a lot of noise when idling. It became quiet. It may have been a problem with the retail cooler (manufactured by DELTA) that originally came with the i3. I ended up splurging by buying an additional i5-10400. By the way, the fan noise of both NIDEC and DELTA when running at full speed is very noisy. In the end, I settled on the following configuration. I don't play games, but use it for Microsoft Office, Youtube, and watching DVD/Blu-ray. It's comfortable.

I remember that for those looking for a decent build not dedicated to gaming this is an excellent choice also considering the integrated graphics which saves on the video card and for those who really want to indulge in a bit of playtime, here Fortnite and similar titles don't work, the only flaw The period is that there are few LGA motherboards at a reasonable price"

intel-i5-10400,5,March/2024,amazon,"Since it is an old product, the price is a rip-off from the vendor, so it is very cost-effective. This choice was made due to the software being used."
intel-i5-10400,5,April/2024,amazon,"Purchased with PRIME H510M-A (new and used) DDR4 26668GB x 2, used CPUFAN on hand, and implemented it in the KX-M01 (purchased this time) slim PC case compatible with MicroATXITX with built-in KEIAN 300wSFX power supply."
intel-i5-10400,5,July/2023,amazon,stable
intel-i5-10400,5,February/2023,amazon,"I was hesitant to buy one without a graphics card, but it came in handy when my graphics card broke. I think the cost performance is good."
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2022,amazon,"Since it was cheap, I purchased it along with an SGX-compatible B460M motherboard (Displayport 1.4: HDR compatible), Windows 10 Pro, SSD, memory, and compatible playback software to build a 4KUltraHD Blu-ray playback PC. In addition to the CPU's SGX function and the intel SGX driver, as expected, there is also a BIOS setting, and it seems that it is essential to set it to SoftWare controlled in Windows 10 like this. Although it has 6 cores and 12 threads, I am satisfied because it is a PC specialized for 4KUltraHD Blu-ray playback. For the latest 4KUHD games, even if you add an RTX30X0 series VGA card, the 10th generation is already two generations old, and considering overclocking etc., we give it a -2 rating. The overall rating is 5, with emphasis on UltraHD Blu-ray playback and cost performance. (However, you can buy a 4KUltraHD Blu-ray player for the sum of the CPU and motherboard...)"
intel-i5-10400,5,September/2021,amazon,"Under normal loads, it is very stable and generates little heat. It feels a little sluggish when editing videos, and the core temperature exceeds 60 degrees."
intel-i5-10400,5,November/2022,amazon,I think it's good for the price. A CPU that is perfect for personal computers.
intel-i5-10400,5,September/2023,amazon,"Influencers are raving about it as being brain-dead, but it's only worth the price. Moreover, the heat is intense. After all, it's a core i5, and its multithreading is comparable to or better than previous i7s. Not suitable for multitasking. It seems like it's compatible with games, but with this level of performance, there's no point in making it yourself. A gaming notebook is sufficient. Unless you have core i9 or ryzen 9, there is no advantage to making it yourself..."
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2021,amazon,"Purchased due to motherboard replacement. Stable operation with no problems. I don't play games, so this is enough."
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2021,amazon,I made the right purchase. It runs smoothly on the PC I assembled at home.
intel-i5-10400,5,October/2020,amazon,"Although it was a new handmade PC, I think it performed better than I expected."
intel-i5-10400,5,July/2021,amazon,"With 6 cores and 12 threads, it feels like a great deal considering the price. One of the deciding factors for me as a student was the stability that is not reflected in numbers. I also saw an article saying that it has better compatibility with the GeForce series than Ryzen, so I bought it. Intel is said to be inferior in terms of performance, but I don't think it's a problem for everyday use. Although it is combined with RTX3060, there is almost no difference compared to the combination of Ryzen and RTX3060 that you often see in articles. It was a good purchase."
intel-i5-10400,5,September/2021,amazon,"I am very satisfied with my first 6 core. Physically, I don't feel much of a difference from the 4 cores, but I'm very satisfied!"
intel-i5-10400,5,October/2021,amazon,I think the performance is sufficient for normal use. I think it's very good considering the cost performance.
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2021,amazon,"Since graphics are expensive, I decided to settle for the built-in graphics until the price drops, so I bought this one. I wanted to play FF14, so I've been playing it without a graphics card and lowering the settings a lot, but I can play it without any problems. It's true that the shadows and other details are rough, but I can play normally."
intel-i5-10400,5,July/2021,amazon,This is a masterpiece CPU with low power consumption and low waste heat.
intel-i5-10400,5,May/2021,amazon,"It should sell well, and outside of gaming, it's definitely a big hit in the first half of 2021. It has good stability and low power consumption."
intel-i5-10400,5,November/2020,amazon,"I purchased an i5 10400 as my first home-built PC. It seems to be compatible with gtx1660super.I bought it around the end of October 2020, but it seems to be about 4,000 yen cheaper than when it was released (I bought it for 21,799 yen)."
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2020,amazon,"I've been using an i7-2600 for many years, and Passmark has more than twice the performance, so I can really experience it. Also, in terms of cost performance, it is very good compared to the 10600 and 10700."
intel-i5-10400,5,March/2021,amazon,Better than Risen for normal use
intel-i5-10400,5,June/2020,amazon,It's for beginners! ! It's enough for those who play Dragon Quest 10.
intel-i5-10400,5,February/2021,amazon,"I love the i7 and have always chosen it, but I was aiming for the i5's cost performance, and I was surprised at how fast it was. I was worried about RYZEN7, but it was so fast that I was satisfied with it."
intel-i5-10400,5,January/2021,amazon,"Replacement from i5-4440 for my parent's main PC. The 6C12T is sufficient for everyday use (surfing the internet, watching 4K videos, creating PDFs). Retail coolers are a bit unsettling, but if you buy a Byakko, you'll be fine. If you won't be using it for more than 5 years, an i3 might be fine. You can also use it as a gaming PC by inserting a graphics card. It loses to Ryzen in multi-core performance, but unless you're a video creator or a professional gamer, you won't notice any difference. By the way, I was able to make it myself without an OS for less than 60,000 yen."
intel-i5-10400,5,January/2021,amazon,The cost performance is very stable.
intel-i5-10400,5,May/2020,amazon,There's nothing to complain about.
intel-i5-10400,5,October/2021,amazon,"While installing the OS (Windows 11), it suddenly stopped working. Even if I replace the motherboard and memory, it doesn't work. When I removed the CPU, the power turned on. I've been using computers for 30 years, and this is my first experience of the CPU stopping. When I tried to request a return or exchange, AMAZON wouldn't accept it, and when I looked at the seller's theory, it was based on AMZOBN.In the end, I gave up. I had to buy it again at Dospara - apparently this is a response to initial defects. I thought it would be safe if I replaced it with Amazon, but the result was disappointing. I paid a tuition fee of 20,000 yen."
intel-i5-10400,5,February/2022,amazon,"I don't understand why it says ""made in china"" even though it's Intel."
intel-i5-10400,5,December/2020,amazon,"The HP desk PC I've been using for about 7 years is getting sluggish, so I decided to take the plunge and replace it with a homemade PC. The PC configuration is as follows. CPU: Core i5 10400F BOXGPU: GeForce GTX1660 SUPER Twin Fan ZT-T16620F-10LMB: B460M Pro4RAM: DDR4-3200 8GB×2(AD4U320038G22-D)ROM: NVMe M.2 SSD 500GB(P1 CT500P1SSD8JP -5698), HDD 1 TB7200rpm (Bulk product) Power supply: SMART 500W STANDARD PS-SPD-0500NPCWJP-Wpc Case: Versa H18 CA-1J4-00S1WN-00OS: Windows 10 Home or earlier PC has CPU: AMD A8-5600kGPU: GTX 750 tiRAM: 8GBROM: HDD It's 500GB, so the perceived speed is crazy (lol)."
intel-i5-10400,5,June/2020,amazon,"When I tested the distribution of the game I purchased on Ark Online, I don't think it's 100% the CPU is at fault, but I only encountered a blue screen once, so I wonder if it's due to a lack of processing power."
intel-i5-10400,5,January/2021,amazon,"It is stable at low temperatures and performs well even in slim towers. I think it is suitable for replacing old environments that use DDR3 memory. I was hesitant about RYZEN5 3600, but this one was fine."
intel-i5-10400,5,March/2021,amazon,"It is rumored to be the best gaming CPU with the best cost performance. I like AMD and recommend Ryzen, which Jim Keller left behind, but I think Intel is more stable. Regarding the game. When I ran FF14 bench with 2560x1440 resolution on this CPU with RADEON VII, the score was over 16,000. By the way, the 9900k and RX6900XT are just under 18,000, which is plenty of room for games like this. Recommended."
intel-i5-10400,5,May/2021,amazon,"Until now, I was using a pentium g3250, but since I mainly surfed the net and didn't play games, it wasn't inconvenient, but I thought it was time for an update, so I was thinking about a Core i3. I was thinking of getting a built-in GPU as the price of graphics cards was rising, and the i5 wasn't much different, so I decided on this one. Anyway, overall it's fast and I have no complaints, and playing light games is stress-free and comfortable. The SSD was MVNe 1TB and the memory was 32GB."
intel-i5-10400,5,September/2021,amazon,"I was wondering about the 11th generation Corei5, but when I researched it, I found that the 10th generation 10400 was better in terms of stability, so I ordered it. Thanks to Amazon's fast shipping, it arrived the next morning and I was able to replace the CPU. Although it was a replacement from corei3 10100, it is still fast and seems to be able to run well on Windows 11."
intel-i5-10400,5,May/2022,amazon,"I switched to i5 6500 because it was defeated by Windows 11. I'm on a tight budget, parts are getting more expensive, and I don't do heavy processing anymore, so an i3 should be enough, but I've been having a rough time with the Celeron at work, so I decided to use it because I wanted to make my home PC as comfortable as possible. It's only natural that I only did light processing, but the purpose was achieved."
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2020,amazon,This is enough. i7 is not required.
intel-i5-10400,5,November/2021,amazon,"I was at a loss for the i7, but I can play games with it. It's stable."
intel-i5-10400,5,July/2021,amazon,"The specs are sufficient for someone who does nothing but surf the internet. Even with the built-in graphics, YouTube looked crisp enough."
intel-i5-10400,5,June/2021,amazon,There is no problem with the temperature.
intel-i5-10400,5,September/2020,amazon,INTEL is definitely the best.
intel-i5-10400,5,September/2022,amazon,It won't start. Can't you exchange it?
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2020,amazon,good
intel-i5-10400,5,July/2020,amazon,"I'm using it in combination with ASUS' PRIME H470M-PLUS (MicroATX), and it's working pretty well. During normal driving, the cooler is quiet and nice. I use PowerDirector, which is lightweight, for video editing, but it only uses about 25% of the CPU's capacity. AMD's CPUs seem to be selling well these days, but I still feel more confident that Intel's CPUs are more compatible with software. Addendum: I tried using it at the rated speed (2.9GHz) without overclocking for about two weeks, but sometimes it would get stuck, so I changed it back to i3-10100 (3.6Ghz). The H470's BIOS does not allow overclocking and requires a Z490 motherboard to overclock. Or, if you don't overclock, it might be better to choose a higher-end i5-10500 or i5-10600."
intel-i5-10400,5,August/2021,amazon,"I chose this CPU because I thought that the i5 would be sufficient since I would not be using it for games or encoding, but for Office applications, the Internet, email, etc. It's running no better than the i7-2600K I've been using. It seems to be quiet and the heat generation is moderately suppressed, probably because I have set the motherboard to save power."

There have been reports that the 10th generation gets extremely hot, but this i5 10600k only generates enough heat that it won't be a problem if you use it regularly."
intel-i5-10600k,5,October/2021,amazon,"I myself use an i7 10700K and a home-built gaming PC, but I was asked to purchase one to build a gaming PC. The extremely hot i9 was out of the question, and the i7 I was currently using seemed to be over spec, so I bought the i5 this time. By the way, the motherboard for both is TUF Z490. Depending on the intended use, I think this is sufficient. I think the key to gaming is the graphics board, so I think it's better to spend the cheaper price of the i5 on the graphics board."

intel-i7-10700k,5,March/2021,amazon,"In my opinion, this processor is the best core of the series. The heat output is very high depending on the performance. It can get up to too hot, so I would recommend a well-cooled system, e.g. water cooling. Otherwise, as I said, very good quality. I'm happy with the high-rise. Price performance is right worth the high price"
intel-i7-10700k,5,April/2021,amazon,"I upgraded after a few years and was surprised that this CPU was relatively cheap. I bought it straight away and am thrilled with the performance and performance. I would buy it again at any time, a clear purchase recommendation"

intel-i7-10700k,5,January/2021,amazon,I recently changed the configuration of my PC and I combined this processor with an Asus Prime ZP RAM Corsair Vengeance DDR GB SSD Samsung EVO GB motherboard and RTX Super video card and I must say that the speed with which before everything loads the operating system at startup which is now reduced to a few seconds what is even more impressive is the speed with which games are loaded loading time of a few seconds when starting a game and a new level of the same what can I say the processor is really a bomb
intel-i7-10700k,5,October/2021,amazon,looking at the negative reviews of some buyers I was a little worried as in practice there were no problems and in any case someone reported the lack of the fan effects Intel specifies that the processor is sold without a fan unlike previous models so in the calculation of the cost you also need to include a good tower cooling
intel-i7-10700k,5,June/2020,amazon,"I have once again chosen an Intel processor which offers similar performance to an it is almost equal and given the monolithic nature it guarantees the absence of latencies of unexpected memory errors caused by them, finally a valid upgrade from the first generation of skylake"

intel-i9-10900k,5,February/2021,amazon,"Currently, Ryzen is in short supply and prices are rising, so I decided to purchase this. I was worried because I've seen bad reviews on the internet about its poor performance, but no matter what game I'm playing, the CPU usage rate rarely exceeds 30%. FPS has never been below 100, let alone 60. I am using it with RTX3080 in a QHD environment. Honestly, all the CPUs have excessive specifications, so I thought there was no need to stick to Ryzen and either one would be fine."
intel-i9-10900k,5,April/2021,amazon,"It's okay, isn't it?"
intel-i9-10900k,5,January/2021,amazon,Arrived safely
intel-i9-10900k,5,February/2021,amazon,"I switched from an i7-8700. When I measured the benchmark, the performance was about twice as high. I mostly only play games, but when I started a few games, the CPU usage sometimes reached 100% and became heavy, but after switching to the latter, that problem no longer happened. I'm satisfied without it. However, since it's only been about a month since I bought it, I'll give it a 4 star rating."
intel-i9-10900k,5,September/2020,amazon,"I'm an amateur who doesn't need that much CPU power, but even as an old man with 23 years of experience making my own, I sometimes want to get my hands on a high-end CPU, so I can enjoy it in the hobby world!"
intel-i9-10900k,5,June/2020,amazon,"Since I am switching from 8086K, heat generation is not a concern. Exporting videos with 10 cores is now more stable and faster."
intel-i9-10900k,5,December/2020,amazon,"It seems that the 9900K was difficult to use due to its extreme heat, but with ITX's simple water cooling, it can be used regularly at MAX 5.4 GHz and average 5.0 GHz without any special settings. The CPU that Gogiger can easily operate is too amazing! After playing Assassin's Creed Valhalla for about an hour, my core temperature averaged 60 degrees in a room temperature of 25 degrees."
intel-i9-10900k,5,June/2020,amazon,"It gets a lot of heat, but it's perfect for gaming."
intel-i9-10900k,5,May/2020,amazon,"This is a CPU that allows you to enjoy the feeling of superiority of owning the most powerful CPU. That's a lie, I've been using an i7-8700K, but my M/B hasn't been working well lately, so I decided to take this opportunity to buy a new one. I've read a lot of comments on various sites, but compared to the 8700K, it's clearly different both on the bench and in terms of experience. It has been said that the price is high, but 9900K was originally priced at just over 60,000 yen, so it was within the expected range. It's a bit disappointing that it's still a 14nm process though..."
intel-i9-10900k,5,December/2020,amazon,It's now easier to take out the contents than when I used the soccer ball last time. That's all. Please understand.

intel-i9-10900k,5,January/2022,amazon,"Super powerful processor I already had a very powerful PC with a K and have now rebuilt the computer with this processor as a basis. I am practically blown away by the performance. Together with the water cooling Corsair HX, the performance in the gaming, music and video sector of this processor is more than inspiring I have it on cores x GHz stable at C next generation multitasking is the order of the day. Given the price it's just a dream but in the end I have to say the money was more than worth it"
