5,12/29/2022 15:34,building pc scratch always bug bios setting adjust optimal performance get bug out performs expected ghz core load temp never above c v team blue way
5,2/23/2022 10:25,cpu score nd percentile cpu mark performance test very fast reliable wa first time installing intel cpu bit trickier amd cpu wa still easy using hyper cooler thing stay nice cool pricier amd counterpart
5,10/21/2021 13:32,super fast make sure proper cooling thing run hot set get temp
5,12/14/2021 7:50,great processor chip get fps chip last next year least able play triple game near max setting
5,11/10/2022 1:28,great cpu perfect pair gtx ti doe not include cpu fan thats perfectly fine buy separate maybe even better cpu fan
5,11/25/2022 11:50,coming k huge difference slowly upgrading pc little little
4,3/4/2022 22:05,clear marking chip make easy install used z motherboard gen capabilites not quite fast rysen x close never problem intel
5,2/18/2022 15:57,work great newest build cant go wrong intel
4,4/21/2021 12:25,wanted give th gen try not break bank decided go k msi za pro already x coupled x tomahawk thats running fine except dreaded usb port issue out box yes x run faster tweak msi bios im currently running ghz core passed cbcbcb aida realbench prime small fft anyone tell chip doesnt run hot hasnt run meaningful stress test chip stock close tweaked beating x even pbo curve optimization manually overclock x using ryzen master bios somewhat take lead again show th gen chip compete youre intel fan viable cpu downside wa routinely pulling w hitting c top even running cb evga aio pull lot run sub even under heavy load core ghz bonus gaming better low higher resolution equally important high solid chip psu cooling tame price le x
4,6/23/2021 22:18,hot boy thats sure great performance gaming though would make great heater cold winter month decided give intel another chance even though many people given intel cause well youre building computer probably know amd better efficient theyre moving forward also didnt cut core thread say processor faster last gen cpu probably switching amd also dont get wrong cpu great get job done long way cool youre still intel fan still cheaper amd would probably good honestly cheaper reason got
5,4/14/2024 21:54,two year pushing intel core ik limit confidently say absolute powerhouse core thread configuration handled everything ive thrown intensive gaming session demanding productivity task performance k consistently delivered topnotch performance whether im editing video compiling code running complex simulation cpu not skipped beat also kept latest game providing smooth immersive experience overclocking enthusiast like overclocking potential delight ive able safely push frequency achieve even better performance k remained stable reliable throughout durability two year processor still running smoothly day one testament build quality engineering went chip value initially price point seemed bit steep given longevity unwavering performance proven worthwhile investment final thought intel core ik crucial part setup no regret purchase product stood test time would highly recommend anyone looking highperformance reliable cpu
