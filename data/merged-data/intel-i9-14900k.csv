intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2024年4月18日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,性能は素晴らしいですが、やはり発熱もトップクラスですね。本格水冷（30㎝ラジエター*3台）で回してますが、それでも無制限のままだとサーマルスロットリングをちょいちょい突きます。定格では最高でも80度行きませんが、無制限の場合電圧のVFカーブをちょっと弄ってやると安定します。現在最高でも89℃と扱いやすくなってます。ただ、電気代の事を考えると正直コスパ面で良い方ではないと思います。エンコードなどその分速度が十分に上がってますが、その分の電気代・・。性能面では最高で満足してます。
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2024年2月4日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,13600kもとても良いCPUですが、14600kも同様に良いCPUです。ただ、世代が1つ違いがあっても、性能に差はありません。でも良いCPUなので、星5つです。
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2024年1月6日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,純正の本物です。強くて速くて安心。問題なく使えています。i9は銀色のディスク型のパッケージも素敵。箱の内側の梱包材を使って立てて飾れるようにできています。グリスについては、上記i9の青いパッケージに同梱されているのではなく、別立てで簡易パッケージに入って添えられてきました。
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2024年1月21日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,13900Kで128GB使ってましたが14900Kは192GBまでサポートしてるので思い切って買いました。性能差はそんなにすごくないのですがオーバークロックして使ってると快適さがわかりますね。インテル派の私にはうれしい製品です。
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2024年2月17日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,当方ここ数年はAMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990Xをメインに使用していましたが、シングルスレッド速度が欲しいのでまず13900Kに行ってから今はこちらに変更しました。3990Xは計算用PCとしています。当方はすぐ殻割りしてしまいますが、13900Kよりさらに発熱が増しており、設定詰めないで使う方にはなかなか難儀なCPUではないでしょうか？また消費電力は無駄に高くて電気代気になる方は厳しいかと。そこらへん気にしなければサクサク動作で快適なCPUです。
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2023年12月2日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,amdと比べ重たいソフトを複数使う際の安定性は素晴らしいですゲームや思いソフトは落ちたことも今のところ有りません。240mmの簡易水冷でも最高で96℃になるので少し発熱多めなのは残念です
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2024年1月23日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,シンプルに！性能・安定感は満足です。i9のK付きモデルを視野に入れるのであれば、ベンチでもそこまでの性能差が出ないので13世代の同じもののほうがコスパは良いかもしれない。OCしても、13世代と性能差は感じられない...。
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2024年3月18日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,次の世代まで我慢できなかったので購入、まぁ爆熱ですよね😅420mmの簡易水冷で使用してましたが私の環境だと90℃張りついちゃいますCorsairのobsidianというクッソでかいケースを買い足し420mmラジエター二つで回してます、良かった点は足元に置いておくと熱風が出るのでヒーターが要らない点ですかね
intel-i9-14900k,5.0,2023年12月5日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,Intel14世代の目玉新機能のうち、悲しいかなWiFi7対応くらいしか取り柄のないi5だが、その実性能は13600kと変わらない様に見える。しかしi5としては厳選石であるからか、OC耐性はそれなりにある様で、私が買った個体は安定して6GHzで動作させられる。クーラーはROG RyujinⅢ 240RGBだがPコア全コア6GHzでもCinebenchR23中も最大98℃で冷やしきれ、シングルコア性能の重視されるゲーム性能はかなり高い。キャッシュを除けば冷やし切れる14900kと考えればこの魅力が伝わるだろうか。値段はやや高いが、Z790マザーを持っているなら14700kが爆熱となった14世代では1番バランスの良いゲーム向けCPU足り得るのではないだろうか。
