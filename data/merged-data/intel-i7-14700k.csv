intel-i7-14700k,5.0,2024年2月3日に日本でレビュー済み,amazon,紙袋に入って届きました。精密機器のかなり高い物なのに相変わらずの雑な梱包はさすがにドン引きする。こういった精密機器はAmazonで買うのは本当におすすめしません。MBを買った時もでかい紙袋。メモリも買った時も紙袋。もちろんM.2も。手軽さからAmazonで購入しましたが考えを改める必要がありますね。やむを得なくAmazonで購入する際はメーカー直売や、お店から直接発送される物を選んで購入しましょう。使用レビューは性能は13genから唯一UPしてる14geni7。4070tiと一緒に使ってますが作業、ゲームどちらも快適です。14genが最後のiシリーズと聞いて購入しました。どうせGPUを取り付けるので、F付きにしました。セールで1万程安く購入してさらにKより安い為断然お得です。安く済むに越した事はないので、その分GPUに予算を割くことを強くおすすめします。グラフィック機能付きはGPUがイカれた時に助かる事は助かりますが、私の場合は過去にGPUがイカれた時にそもそもCPUだけでできる事は限られていた為、結果新しいGPUを購入するまでPCは使いませんでした。その経験を活かし今ではミドルスペックくらいのGPUを一つ予備に購入しました。F付きの難点はGPUがないとBIOSどころか、画面すらつかない為、新しく自作する場合や初めての自作に挑戦する方は、購入する順番を考えないと動作確認が出来ませんので、そこだけ気をつけましょう。商品的には満足ですが、発送方法がまずいので⭐︎3で。
