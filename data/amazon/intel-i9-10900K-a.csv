Intel Amazon.co.jp：カスタマーレビュー: INTEL CPU BX8070110900K Core i9-10900K プロセッサー 3.7GHz 20MB キャッシュ 10コア 日本正規流通商品,5.0,2021年2月17日に日本でレビュー済み,現在Ryzenが品薄＋値上がり傾向にあるので、こちらを購入してみました。ネットで性能が悪いと酷評を付けられているので不安でしたが、どんなゲームをしていてもCPU使用率が30%を超えることはまずありません。FPSも60どころか100を割ることは、今のところありません。QHD環境でRTX3080と合わせて使用しています。どのCPUも正直過剰スペックであり、別にRyzenにこだわる必要はなくどちらでも良いんじゃないかと思いました。
