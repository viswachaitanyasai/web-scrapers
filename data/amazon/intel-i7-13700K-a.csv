Intel Amazon.co.jp：カスタマーレビュー: intel インテル CPU 第13世代 Core i7-13700K BOX BX8071513700K / 国内正規流通品,5.0,2023年1月14日に日本でレビュー済み,電力制限なしの250W前後で回すとi7 12700Kは相手にならずi9 12900Kをも軽くぶち抜く性能ですが他の方も仰る通り爆熱過ぎる事態に…しかし190W(i7 12700Kと同)に設定するだけでもi9 12900Kを凌駕する驚愕のCPUで性能低下自体は−数%程度である事から私(簡易水冷)は190Wで運用して満足出来ています。絶対に空冷(大型)で使いたいって方は、140W前後だと問題なく冷やせてi7 12700Kより全然強いまま低電力で運用できるのかなと思われます。結論:電力制限すればワットパフォーマンスは最高に良く発熱も穏やかなCPU。intelがライバルCPUと競う為に、無駄に電力爆盛したように思えます。
Intel Amazon.co.jp：カスタマーレビュー: intel インテル CPU 第13世代 Core i7-13700K BOX BX8071513700K / 国内正規流通品,5.0,2022年12月18日に日本でレビュー済み,元々第7世代i7-7700kからの買い替えです。性能は大幅にアップしました！！大満足です☺配信ソフトなど同時に多数起動させていますが、今のところ処理性能が足りないなんてことはありません。ただ熱は持ちやすいです。空冷だと冷やせるか分かりません…私は簡易水冷を使ってます！参考までに！
Intel Amazon.co.jp：カスタマーレビュー: intel インテル CPU 第13世代 Core i7-13700K BOX BX8071513700K / 国内正規流通品,5.0,2022年11月23日に日本でレビュー済み,最上位モデルのCore i9-13900kと悩みましたが、コア数同スペックでピーク性能とワットパフォーマンスが向上しているこちらのCore i7-13700kを選びました。Z690マザーボードで運用していますがBIOSが対応していれば特に問題なし。最近のマザーボードは電源だけあればBIOS更新可能なので非対応BIOSでも問題ないことが多いです。デバイスドライバ類は事前に最新に更新（又は新規インストールの場合はダウンロード）しておくことをお勧めします。CinebenchR23のスコアはマルチ30552、シングル2082。Core i9-12900Kから約1割程度スコアが伸びていて、フルロード時の消費電力は約30Wほど低くなっているのでいい感じです。10nmと他社の現行製品と比べると２～３世代落ちなプロセスルールで健闘しているとは思いますが、360mm簡易水冷クーラー必須な点はAlder Lakeから変わらず評価が分かれるかと思います。フルロード時のワットパフォーマンスは正直微妙です。今回取り付けたのはゲーミングPC用なので動画のエンコードなどはさせないため個人的には大満足です。エンコード処理メインなら大型空冷クーラーで問題なく動作する旧型ですが扱いやすく、価格も安くなっているRyzen 9 5950Xをおすすめします。ゲームメインならシングルスレッド性能の高いCore i7-13700kはワットパフォーマンスもコストパフォーマンスも高いのでおすすめです！
