Intel Corei7 プロセッサー 12700K 3.6GHz( 最大 5.0GHz ) 第12世代 LGA 1700 BX8071512700K/A,5.0,2021年12月14日に日本でレビュー済み,12900Kより冷え消費電力も少ない、そして二万円くらい安いゲーミング性能はフルHDだと12900Kが平均6fpsくらい勝つそして5900Xより12700kの方が平均fpsがそこそこ高いWQHDや4kだとCPUでそこまでのfpsの差は変わらないDDR4でも12700Kは5900Xよりもほぼいろんなスコアで上です簡単にまとめると5950Xにシングルで勝ち、5900Xにマルチで勝つ五万という値段で最強CPUということですゲームしかやらない＝12600Kゲームももちろんだけど他にもいろんなこともする＝12700K発熱気にしないでゲームもいろんなこともしたくて、最強CPUがいい＝12900Kという感じですねちなみに私は12700KはノクチュアのU12Aブラックを使っております12900Kは厳しいらしいけど12700Kは室温26度で普通に冷やせます(シネベンチr2310分で80度も行かない)前世代Intel最強11900Kを簡単にぶっ倒し、5900Xを負かし、5950Xにシングルスコアで勝つ12700Kはもはや敵なしです
