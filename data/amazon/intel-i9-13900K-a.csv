Intel Amazon.co.jp：カスタマーレビュー: intel インテル CPU 第13世代 Core i9-13900K BOX BX8071513900K / 国内正規流通品,5.0,2024年3月8日に日本でレビュー済み,i9シリーズが発売されてからずっとi9を購入していますが、今回はさらにすごく爆熱です。24コア32スレッド5.8Ghz仕様で、マザーボードベンダーも電力無制限設定をデフォルトにしているので、ポン付けでは360mm簡易水冷でもベンチマークソフトなどでは秒で100℃です。ですが、ちょっと低電圧化すれば性能を下げることなく360mm簡易水冷はもちろんのこと、ハイエンド空冷でも運用できます。マザボベンダー各社によって設定はありますが、私はMSIなので、Lite Loadを利用しています。これによってNoctua D-15でサイバーパンク2077などのCPUをガッツリ使うゲーム中でも、室温27℃前後で4K 60fpsなら最大75℃ほどに抑えられます。フルスレ使用するとさすがに低電圧化してもハイエンド空冷では厳しいと思います。その場合はいさぎよく360mm以上の水冷が良いと思います。ゲーム程度でしたら上記のようにすればハイエンド空冷でもいけます。ちょっといじれば使いやすい万能超高性能CPUなのでおすすめです。
